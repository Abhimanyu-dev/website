There were no resume shortlisting criteria initially, but the software role was open for circuital branches only. There was an Online Assessment based upon aptitude, technical and coding skills. Next round was resume shortlisting followed by two interviews first technical and second technical + HR.

##  Insights on the interview process
1)In the first round, they asked me DSA based questions. The first coding question was based upon time complexity and greedy algorithm. The second question was based upon graphs. In both the questions, they first asked the brute force approach and then asked to write the optimized code. 2)The second round was the HR round in which they asked questions based upon the resume (internship, projects, PORs, courses) and HR questions.

1. Check whether there exists a triplet (i, j, k) such that arr[i] < arr[k] < arr[j] for i < j < k 2. Minimum time required to rotten all oranges 3.
