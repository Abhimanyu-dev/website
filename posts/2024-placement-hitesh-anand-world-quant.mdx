##  Insights on the interview process
1. It was a pretty basic round and consisted of basic probability and statistics questions and few puzzles. 2. In second round too they asked prob stats questions but this time they were quite advanced. 3. This was a mixed kind of round in which they asked some HR questions like my intern in Quadeye and some technical questions based on Algorithms. 4. Their senior director was present, he asked some question about my work at Quadeye and Projects I worked on then he too asked some Quant and finance questions and in the end he asked some questions about my preferences and why I want to join quant . 5. The last round was a standard HR round.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1. The question was something like - There’s a m*m chess-like grid and I have to cover each square with coins such that sum of coins on each row and column is even. 2. Some basics question like – 100^99 or 99^100 which is the bigger number, here you have to use some combinatorics to compare the two numbers.

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Don’t panic even if the environment around you is negative because there’s high chance that you talk to someone and hear something negative. Don’t lose you motivation to practice, just be disciplined for a month or two. I know things can get difficult but try to be consistent. Don’t be like you study 10 hours one day and then you’re exhausted for 3 days, rather study 5-6 hours a day for 4 days. After you’re done with your practice it is important that you try to explain your work, just like in an interview, be it your code or even your past projects, that too in English because fluent communication is also quite important. For your HR round, prepare for standard HR questions in advance and be confident in whatever you say. For Resume, keep it clean, avoid typing errors and grammatical mistakes as it creates a bad impression, also instead of spamming projects in your resume its better to mention those projects which are relevant for your profile and you’re confident in.
