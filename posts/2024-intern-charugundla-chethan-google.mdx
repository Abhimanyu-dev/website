## Insights on the Interview Process
Interview is not bounded by total number of questions. Bounded by time which is 45 minutes. Questions are coding based on DSA and CP. First you are asked to explain your logic then you are asked to write code

## Sample Interview Questions
You are required to complete some courses. Each course may have pre-requisite courses i.e. for taking a course c in a particular semester, you have to complete all pre-requisite courses of c in any of previous semesters. There is no upper bound on the number of courses in one semester i.e. you can take any number of courses in one semester given that you completed all the pre-requisite courses of each course you are taking. Design and code the algorithm for finding the minimum number of semesters that are required to complete all given courses.

##  Preparation Resources
Codeforces, codechef, atcoder and leetcode contests for practice. Leetcode hard problems for practice. Slides of DSA course and online CP handbook by Antti Laaksonen. Note- some of the questions asked in the interviews and online assessments are directly from leetcode(hard).

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Don’t worry if you can’t think of any efficient solution, try to give brute force solution which is also fine. If you give brute force solution then you are asked to think of an efficient solution. Don’t worry about the total number of questions, try to give efficient solution for at least one question which is also enough to clear the interview.
