##  Insights on the interview process
Test has aptitude and coding MCQ questions. It was a pen paper test with different sets and moderate questions for the technical aspect and easy to moderate for the aptitude aspect. Round 1 of Interviews were taken by junior members of the recruiting team and the questions were brainstellar type and they asked a couple of coding questions and my preference for tech or consulting. Round 2 was a complete stress test and character test. It was taken by CXO level recruiters. I was asked questions on my resume and abstract questions to test critical thinking.

Round 1 What sorting algorithms do you know? Can you list down OOPS principles? Ant has to travel from one edge of the cube to the other what is the shortest distance on the surface? Round 2 What would you do if you were UP’s CM for a day? What do you think you’re good at amongst everyone else?

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
1.It would be for the whole placement season in itself and its preparation. Make a plan start early. 2.A lot of people don’t prepare enough, if you take them as your anchor or you think this is how much everyone must be preparing then you’d be wrong. 3.Take yourself as a benchmark and keep improving daily. Prepare your introduction well, know what’s on your resume, and learn to stay calm and confident in high pressure situations. 4. I entered all interview rooms thinking I have already been rejected this is only practice. 5.Don’t lose your self-confidence over some company not accepting you, there’s a lot that goes on including luck.
