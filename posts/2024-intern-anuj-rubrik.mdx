Anuj, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Anuj, 210166 CSE Branch. student  will do
 summer internship in Rubrik Software Intern profile at Rubrik. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Quadeye (Systems) Alphagrep (Systems) DE Shaw JPMC Rubrik Optiver (Systems) Google

## Insights on the Selection Process
Shortlisting on the basis of test. Then Interview, 2 Technical rounds, 1 HR round.

## Insights on the Interview Process
His interview at Rubrik was scheduled at 8AM on Day 1. There were 3 rounds, 2 coding and 1 HR round taking around 2 and a half hours. As compared to other companies where he interviewed, he found that the level of questions was slightly more advanced (comparable to leetcode hard problems), however the interviewers were giving hints that helped in making progress. The HR round was quite simple, they asked about his interest in software engineering and asked him to go through one of the web development projects in his resume in detail (like why did you choose this framework, how did you test it, etc.). At the end, they offered him the intern position right there, though he accepted it later after giving 3 more interviews.

## Sample Interview Questions
There were 2 long coding questions (one each round), the interviewer kept on increasing the question difficulty by introducing new constraints on the problem when he made progress. For Rubrik, he would recommend having some exposure to Competitive Programming but completing most of the hard questions on leetcode should also suffice. Also, try to get a good hold over coding (they were not satisfied by just the algorithm idea, they wanted exact working code), so make sure that you can comfortably code your ideas.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do’s- Start preparing early, because at the end of summer, tests will literally leave no time for skill building. Start at the beginning of summer if you want to learn any new skill/ improve coding. Focus on OOP concepts, they are asked a lot in quant firms (Optiver and alphagrep had a round specifically for OOP). Try to work on good self-projects which you can showcase in your resume as well. Don'ts- Don’t start everything in the suggested resources at once, and it is fine if you don’t cover all the resources, first focus on understanding the higher level concepts and then practice more questions. If you attempt a coding problem, write actual code and not just the idea, translating your ideas into code is a very important skill in tests and interviews. Don’t just solve the complete question in the mind (applicable to both puzzles as well as coding problems), try to interactively solve them with friends, it improves your ability to express your ideas better.
