## Advice for students (dos and don�ts)? 
Do�s: 

Start preparing early, because at the end of summer, tests will literally leave no time for skill building. Start at the beginning of summer if you want to learn any new skill/ improve coding.

 

Focus on OOP concepts, they are asked a lot in quant firms (Optiver and alphagrep had a round specifically for OOP).

 

Try to work on good self-projects which you can showcase in your resume as well.

 

Don'ts:

Don�t start everything in the suggested resources at once, and it is fine if you don�t cover all the resources, first focus on understanding the higher level concepts and then practice more questions.

 

If you attempt a coding problem, write actual code and not just the idea, translating your ideas into code is a very important skill in tests and interviews.

 

Don�t just solve the complete question in the mind (applicable to both puzzles as well as coding problems), try to interactively solve them with friends, it improves your ability to express your ideas better.
