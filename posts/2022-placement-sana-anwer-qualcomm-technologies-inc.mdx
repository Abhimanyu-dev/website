Sana Anwer, studying in IIT Kanpur as a MT student in EE will be joining Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. as Modern FW Engineer. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Qualcomm - Modem FW Engineer
Intel - SDE

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume shortlist 
2. Written test – aptitude, programming and technical 
3. Three rounds of interview 

I only gave 3 rounds of interviews for Qualcomm. It was my first ever experience of placement interviews as I never sat for placements in B.Tech. I was nervous but the interviewers were quite helpful and friendly. They were giving hints and guiding me if I was stuck in some question. So, such friendly interaction lessened my nervousness. I tried to give intuitions for the questions | didn't know the exact answers. 

##  Preparation Resources
1. Communication Systems book by Simon Haykin 
2. Digital Signal Processing book by Oppenheim - Chapter 4 and 5 only 
3. Geeks for Geeks for C language based questions 
4. Gate level aptitude questions 
5. Previous written test and interview questions given by seniors 


## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Prepare your basics very well. Instead of tough questions first solve easier ones in written test since there will be time constraints. Don't spend much time on a single question. There may be negative markings so avoid guess work. Prepare all three sections well, don't take the aptitude section lightly. It can be the most scoring section. Keep practicing at least 10 questions daily for aptitude and C output questions. Force yourself to do so even if you feel like skipping. Consistency is better than perfection. For the interviews don't sit silently even if you don't know the exact solution. Try your best guess. If it's correct the interviewers will guide you further. If it's not, they may give you some hints to start off and build upon further.
