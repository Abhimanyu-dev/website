Name Vinoba Pandey Roll Number 19807974 BT-MT Dual Degree Mechanical Engineering, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Bajaj Electricals, Graduate Engineering Trainee. Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
LR VVF Finmechanics Mastercard Mathworks

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
Resume shortlist followed by a test (technical+aptitude). On the placement day we had one GD and interviews immediately after that

##  Insights on the interview process
Interviews were focused on the basics of your discipline (Mechanical Engineering in my case) and your projects/internship work. I was asked about the basics of thermodynamics and theory of machines. I had worked as an operations intern at Dr. Reddyâ€™s Laboratories, so I was questioned on the same and also on manufacturing in general. I had worked at Siemens on the digital twin technology and was grilled on that.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1. Efficiency of Carnot engine 2. Slider bar mechanism and its application 3. Efficiency of IC engines 4. Working capacity of a manufacturing plant 5. Digital twin technology, and explain physics informed neural networks

## Preparation Resources
ESO201, ESO202 and TA202 notes for the technical tests Brushed up my resume for the interview

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Revise your basics and be well prepared with your resume. Do not cut others while they are speaking in GDs and speak up only when you get a chance. Be aware of the latest technology around you.
