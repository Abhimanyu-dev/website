Prashant Kumar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a B.Tech. student in CSE will be joining Glean as Software Engineer. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Glean - Software, Quadeye - systems, Graviton - systems, Tower Research - systems

## Insights on the Selection Process
There was a resume shortlist directly followed by interviews. Shortlisting was primarily done on the basis of CPI and department (CSE, EE, MTH) which I find a very unfair way of doing things based on my experience of the skills of people. There were 3 rounds of interviews, all technical.

First round was technical, the question was not that tough and there was more emphasis on implementation. In the next round, they asked questions about my resume and about my future plans and told me details about the company as they are a fairly new startup. The last round had a medium level coding question on parenthesis.

##  Preparation Resources
* Leetcode
* Geeks for geek articles
* [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
* Codeforces
* [Brainstellar](https://brainstellar.com/)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
* Start early and try to solve some questions every day
* Keep a list of questions or concepts you struggled with and revise it after 2-3 weeks
* Don’t waste your time on high-level topics a lot and focus more on the basics
* Thinking about the solution is important so don’t jump straight to the answers if you can’t solve something
* Eat healthily and take 6-8 hrs of sleep during the placement season. You won’t want to get sick at that time.
* Do some physical exercise, jogging, etc. This will help with stress.
* Feel free to contact any senior and ask for advice. They will be happy to help!
