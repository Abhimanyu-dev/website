## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do not postpone or delay your preparation for internships in the summer. You can excel even if you have not started the preparation before summer and get ahead of your batchmates. Just set a target and do everything to achieve the same. If you get placed in the first month of the internships which is by Sept Mid you will get a lot of time to focus and enjoy on other things.
Select a primary profile to target in the internships but do not leave the other profiles, keep looking for opportunities even if you do not get placed during the Phase 1 of internships.
Just work on your skills and you will definitely get an internship either from SPO or through some off campus if you have the desired skills(even though you do not have the cpi).
