It contains some very goodinterview questions. Practicing these questions for SQL would be enough I guess. Try to learnfrom the solution given. You can read the DBMS theory part from youtube or geeksforgeeksor resources section of interviewbit.For probability, I used brainstellar and 50 challenging problems book.For machine learning and related topics, I read from geeksforgeeks and towardsdatasciencearticles.Also, I found resources section of interviewbit very helpful. It contains topicwise notes andinterview questions.
