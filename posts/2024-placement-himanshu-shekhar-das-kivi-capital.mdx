Himanshu Shekhar Das 19817380 MS-BS MTH, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Kivi Capital- Quant Developer. Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Sprinklr- Data Scientists Sprinklr- Product Engineer NK Securities Research- Software Developer Zomato- SDE1 Plutus Research Private Limited- Quant Analyst Juniper Networks- ML Juniper Networks- SDE Navi- DS

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
Opened only for circuital branches 1-Technical test round (3-sections2-easy coding questions, around 10 Prob stats questions,2- medium to hard coding), each section had separate time control Technical interview HR (kind of both technical and HR mixed)

##  Insights on the interview process
1st round Basic DSA question to test you ability on coding skills 2nd round medium to hard DSA, to test your ability of problem solving and DSA 3rd round resume grind. Discussion on my thesis. Had to explain in detail all the work done. Took around 1.5hrs 4th round chill round with the manager. Just to check if the developer role fits me or do I want to change to strategy role. (They don’t allow it) It was just a way to filter out.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1st round you have a Tree. Print the top, bottom right, left views. Had to implement the tree from scratch and without an IDE(just a text editor). I had to write precise error free code. 2nd round Word Ladder I and II Leetcode. Another DSA question on DP 3rd round why dual? Full resume grind in detail. 1 puzzle- There was an amoeba which dies, stays the same or replicate to 2 with equal probability. What is the probability that the population will die out if at the start there was 1 amoeba. Something like that, I forgot the exact probability. Then, answer was with probability 1 it will die out. Then He asked why? 4th round some personal questions. Why dual?

## Preparation Resources
DSA- interviewbit, Leetcode, GFG CP- codeforces, CSES, CP-Algorithms, Competitive Programmer’s Handbook, Placement Archive by Pclub (is a must if you can’t give codefoces contests) Puzzles- 50 challanging, Brainsteller, Cut the Knot (good for prob and stats puzzles), xinfeng zhou ML and prob stats revision- 771 slides by Piyush Rai, The Hundred- Page ML book

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Now matter how many days left just start the preparation donot wait for tomorrow, or next week or the start of next month. For those who want quant profile your 1st preference should be coding not puzzles. (In Kivi interview there was a guy who had JaneStreet intern, got rejected in the 1st round because he could not implement linked list. The recruiters told me). Start your SQL practice early. A lot of companies ask SQL and most people just keep it for the last and couldn’t prepare properly. Don’t just stay silent just because you don’t have the perfect answer in the interview. Just think out loud.
