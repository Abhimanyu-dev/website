Ujjwal Pratap Singh, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Dual Degree student in MSE will be joining Accenture Strategy and Consulting  as Analyst. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1. Micron (Modeling Engineer)
2. Meesho (SDE)
3. Hilabs (Data Science)
4. Indus Insights (Associate)
5. ShareChat (Decision Scientist)
6. Myntra (Data Analytics)
7. Tata 1mg (SDE)

## Insights on the Selection Process
The Profile was open for Dual Degree and M.Tech students.
There was a test (Coding+SQL+Aptitude) and the selected students were directly called for the interview process.

There were three rounds:
1. Coding round: Asked four easy coding questions. Knowledge of Python and
SQL will be a plus.
2. Case Study round: Interviewer asked a very basic case study. No formal
knowledge of case solving required.
3. HR: Interviewer asked standard HR questions, nothing tricky.

Sample Interview Questions:
1.Coding: Some easy coding questions.
2. Case Study round:
What are the parameters you would keep in mind while deciding the location for
your lemonade stand?
How would you increase your sales?
3. HR:
Why not going for higher studies?
Things you missed out on in your college life.
Mention some strengths and occasions where you showcased your strengths.

##  Preparation Resources
I was targeting Software and Data Analytics companies, so I used following resources:
Coding: GfG (DSA self paced course) and Interviewbit (problem solving)
Aptitude and Prob-Stats: Prepleaf (lectures and tests)
Puzzle: Brainstellar and GfG

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1. If you are able to decide which profile you want to apply, then it would save a lot of efforts during your prepration.
2. Students eyeing SDE profiles should pick one coding platform and stick to it during their entire preparation.
