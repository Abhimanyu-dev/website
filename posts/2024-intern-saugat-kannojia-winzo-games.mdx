saugat kannojia, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Saugat Kannojia will do
 summer internship in winzo games (SDE) profile at WInzo games. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Sprinklr, Oracle,

## Insights on the Selection Process
There were three rounds in total- 1.Technical Test – They asked a fundamental question and tougher questions from topics like DP and graphs. The deciding factor was their platform usage, since you had to solve it on their platform without any Autocomplete and had very different patterns of taking in the input. 2.Round 1 – There was only one question asked to me from Heaps, and the requirement was to code it and run it on your system to show the correct output. Its difficulty was almost Leetcode Hard. 3.Round 2(Final) – This was the round where you had to show your temperament while thinking about things, which, in my opinion, was an excellent approach to an interview. The interviewer wanted to know how the person thinks and what their way of optimizing things is. He made me go through one question, which was just a discussion on how to solve it, starting from brute force and discussing it up to the level that it gets very optimized after 4-5 approaches that we discussed. Then came a lot of basic aptitude-based coding questions that tested out-of- the-box thinking skills.

##  Preparation Resources
Watch Striver DP and Graphs series, its way too good. Solve Codeforces questions for a better chance at technical tests (really the deciding factor in shortlisting) and in general increment of your coding skills.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Solve a lot of Leetcode and Interviewbit questions and understand them rather than learn them, and really understand all the questions that you attempt during the phase of technical tests, that makes you grow a lot. I think asking a good question to the interviewer at the end can make a good impression as well, but not always necessary.
