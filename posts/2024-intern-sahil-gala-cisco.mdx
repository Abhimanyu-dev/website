## Insights on the Selection Process
The first step in the recruitment process was a nationwide CodeThon. It comprised of good level of DSA questions. I was included in the extended shortlist from the codethon. Then, there was an online assessment for the extended shortlist candidates comprising of 3 coding questions, and I solved 2 of them and was selected for the interview.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 

Projects are very important as it makes you stand apart from others. I did projects in ML, Web Dev and Robotics. I also did internship in SURGE. Self projects are also good peaks for resume.
Practicing techno-managerial questions before hand by giving mock interviews is a must to give the HR round confidently. As in Cisco’s process many candidates cleared the first 2 rounds but were rejected in HR round.
Giving mock interview on interview-bit and other websites or even to your seniors who have cleared the interviews will be helpful.
CS fundamentals are also important and can be asked in interviews, so remember to cover them too.
