Sahil Gala, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Sahil Gala BT ME 210895 student  will do
 summer internship in Cisco(Software) profile at Cisco. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Oracle (Software) Microsoft (TPM) Cisco(Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
The first step in the recruitment process was a nationwide CodeThon. It comprised of good level of DSA questions. I was included in the extended shortlist from the codethon. Then, there was an online assessment for the extended shortlist candidates comprising of 3 coding questions, and I solved 2 of them and was selected for the interview.

## Insights on the Interview Process
Interview had 3 rounds. The first two were technical rounds of 45 minutes each, comprising of DSA questions based on Linked list, DP and arrays. The questions were on the difficult side. The third round was an HR round for around 15 minutes including managerial questions testing a candidate’s potential of performing in the company.

## Sample Interview Questions
Resources- Geeks for geeks, Interview-Bit, Leet code (medium and hard) are all good resources for dsa preparation. Solving DSA sheets from these platforms helps a lot as the questions are usually similar. For studying DSA, courses from Programming Pathshala and Geeks for Geeks are good.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Projects are very important as it makes you stand apart from others. I did projects in ML, Web Dev and Robotics. I also did internship in SURGE. Self projects are also good peaks for resume. Practicing techno-managerial questions before hand by giving mock interviews is a must to give the HR round confidently. As in Cisco’s process many candidates cleared the first 2 rounds but were rejected in HR round. Giving mock interview on interview-bit and other websites or even to your seniors who have cleared the interviews will be helpful. CS fundamentals are also important and can be asked in interviews, so remember to cover them too.
