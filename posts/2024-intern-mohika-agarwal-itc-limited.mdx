## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:

## Insights on the Selection Process
ITC/HUL – Resume submission It was resume submission along with a form. The form basically contained everything from the resume for both, with a few more details like semester-wise SPIs, etc. for ITC. The form was not to be written in the form of a resume however, and asked things in a very subjective manner, along with insights that you derived from your experiences. Video/GD Round For HUL, this was an online video submission round. There were 3 questions, which were problem solving based and answers were supposed to be focused on your approach to the problem and not the solution to the problem itself. For ITC, this was a GD. Interview Round For HUL, this was an online interview round, and had both core and HR questions. For ITC, there were 2 interviews. Both were resume-based and technical. The second one also had HR based questions. GS – Resume submission. Coding test PPT and informal discussion Interview round 1 Technical round (Did not continue further)

##  Preparation Resources
The mock GDs conducted by AnC are good for the preparation.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do not panic. The process is stressful but know that you will get through it. Keep talking to seniors, and feel free to reach out whenever needed. Be confident and communicate well with the interviewers.
