Mohika Agarwal, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Mohika Agarwal 210623 ME BTech student  will do
 summer internship in ITC-Techno-managerial profile at ITC LIMITED. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
HUL, Goldman Sachs

## Insights on the Selection Process
ITC/HUL – Resume submission- It was resume submission along with a form. The form basically contained everything from the resume for both, with a few more details like semester-wise SPIs, etc. for ITC. The form was not to be written in the form of a resume however, and asked things in a very subjective manner, along with insights that you derived from your experiences. Video/GD Round- For HUL, this was an online video submission round. There were 3 questions, which were problem solving based and answers were supposed to be focused on your approach to the problem and not the solution to the problem itself. For ITC, this was a GD. Interview Round- For HUL, this was an online interview round, and had both core and HR questions. For ITC, there were 2 interviews. Both were resume-based and technical. The second one also had HR based questions. GS – Resume submission. Coding test PPT and informal discussion Interview round 1- Technical round (Did not continue further)

## Insights on the Interview Process
The process for ITC/HUL was very similar. People usually take the first round lightly, and do not focus a lot on the form. This round in my opinion weighs in equally. Spend some good time with it and think through your answers for the forms. The questions for both are very similar, I would suggest that you keep note of your answers separately. The judgement criteria for the video/GD round, I think is how clearly can you structure your thoughts about the problem at hand, communicate it in a productive manner. For the interviews, you should be confident with your knowledge of your core courses and projects. You should also be well prepared to answer all questions based on your resume. Prepare HR questions beforehand.

## Sample Interview Questions
nan

##  Preparation Resources
The mock GDs conducted by AnC are good for the preparation.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do not panic. The process is stressful but know that you will get through it. Keep talking to seniors, and feel free to reach out whenever needed. Be confident and communicate well with the interviewers.
