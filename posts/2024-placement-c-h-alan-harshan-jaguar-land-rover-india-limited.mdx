I am Alan Harshan, roll number 200286. I am part of the 2020-2024 B-Tech EE batch, IITK. I will be joining Jaguar Land Rover as Graduate Hardware Design Engineering Trainee., studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Company Jaguar Land Rover Profile Hardware Design Engineering Trainee. Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
N.A.

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
1) Online test- Had questions related to the profile chosen, few aptitude quesions and 3 coding questions. 2) 1 technical cum HR interview (45 min to 1hr)

##  Insights on the interview process
Interview lasted 45 min to 1 hr. Had 3 interviewers. Includes both technical and HR questions. They asked questions about the project and internship I did. Then basic questions from power electronics, control systems and analog-digital electronics were asked. The last 5 to 10 min were HR questions.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1)Draw a buck converter and explain its working 2)Draw a full bridge rectifier. What’s the output frequency if a 50Hz sinusoid is fed as input? 3)What’s the voltage drop across the parallel combination of two ideal diodes made of Si and Ge respectively when it conducts? 4)Draw the block diagram of a negative feedback system. How to identify if a system is in negative feedback or not? 5)What is meant by a fully differential amplifier? Draw the schematic of an inverting amplifier with a gain of -2 using it. (Based on a project I did)

## Preparation Resources
ESC201,EE210, EE370, EE360 lecture slides

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Start preparing well in advance. Go through the relevant study materials. Have thorough understanding about the points mentioned in the resume. Be prepared to attempt few basic coding questions in the online test. When in an interview, make sure that you walk them through your thought process.
