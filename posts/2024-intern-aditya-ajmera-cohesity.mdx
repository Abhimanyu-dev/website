Aditya Ajmera, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Aditya Ajmera B-tech CSE 210056 student  will do
 summer internship in Cohesity(Software) profile at Cohesity. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Cohesity(Software) Optiver(Quant Trader)

## Insights on the Selection Process
The company was open only for CSE candidates. The first step was an online assessment with questions from common DSA topics including dp and graphs. This was followed by release of shortlist and interview.

## Insights on the Interview Process
There were 2 rounds of interview. The first was a technical round with DSA questions similar to the test for around 1 hour. The second was an HR round with discussion on a UGP that I had done.

## Sample Interview Questions
I did interview-bit in summer for preparing for DSA. Leetcode is also a helpful resource as its interface is similar to the test interface. Preparing a good resume is also very important. Projects are an important part of resume. I had one course project and a UGP. Knowing the details of your project is necessary as anything related to that can be discussed.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Build a good resume with projects. DSA is the most important key to get into any software role. Giving mock interviews gives you a better taste of the interview process. Give at least 2-3 mock interviews on websites such as interview-bit or ask help from your seniors who have cracked such interviews to take your mock.
