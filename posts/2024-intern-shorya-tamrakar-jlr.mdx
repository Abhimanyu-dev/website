Shorya Tamrakar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Shorya Tamrakar
210993
CHE – Btech will do
 summer internship in Jaguar Land rover India Limited&#39;s software intern profile at JLR. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:

Goldman Shacs (for round 1 )
ITC ( gd )
Amazon -not given
Bny -not given
At JPMC, they asked me some basic math and probability questions, like coloring a cube and
cutting it into pieces. Then they asked about the chance of a certain number coming up. After
that, they asked a harder probability question, giving hints, but I didn&#39;t know the topic. They
also gave a question that seemed unrelated to data structures but actually was, and that was
about wanting to visit Kanpur, which also involved DSA concepts.

## Insights on the Selection Process

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Your practice should be consistent. It&#39;s okay to take breaks in between, but don&#39;t give up.
Starting can be tough, especially if you&#39;re new to the field, but don&#39;t lose hope. Remember,
daily practice is essential. You need to cover all the parts, and if you&#39;re struggling, don&#39;t give
up. Just start with one channel and if you are understanding then continue with this .
