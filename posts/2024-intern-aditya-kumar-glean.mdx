Aditya Kumar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Aditya Kumar Roll No. - 210060 Branch- CSE Programme- B.Tech student  will do
 summer internship in Tower(Limestone) Quadeye Glean Samsung Korea Quantbox(Core) profile at Glean. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Glean Software Engineer

## Insights on the Selection Process
Direct Shortlisting based on Resume. 3 Rounds of coding interview

## Insights on the Interview Process
In each coding interview I was required to solve one question in half an hour each. The questions were moderate and not too difficult. In fact, two of them were almost directly from the P-club archives.

## Sample Interview Questions
I had written all the interview questions just a day after Day 1. Here is the link to that document. Do check it out if you want to know more about my experience with other companies. https-//docs.google.com/document/d/1DWeAVXTrCV49utKulgbeXe kfvAZH5hzr/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=102689096991404191857&amp;rtp of=true&amp;sd=true

##  Preparation Resources
I mainly focused on Leetcode to solve problems. Interviewbit is yet another resource, but I did not like its Interface. I also regularly gave P-club archive contests, which significantly increased my overall confidence. For the quant role, I did 50 CP, puzzle quant and some Heard on the Street.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Don’t quit. There will be times when you might feel that all this is useless, and I’ll be happy with an internship that pays less, but don’t let those thoughts take over. Consistency is everything, and even if you feel demotivated, you must not give up. Prepare in groups. This is indeed a double-edged sword. It might favour you or not, but it totally depends on you. But I feel that if you know what your peers are doing, you tend to feel motivated towards your goal. Talk to seniors. We are always there to help and guide you. So whenever you feel demotivated, just call any of your seniors, and they will give you the right advice. Believe me, we have already gone through what you are going through, so we can understand your situation much better.
