Aditya Kumar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Aditya Kumar Roll No.  210060 Branch CSE Programme B.Tech will do
 summer internship in Tower(Limestone) Quadeye Glean Samsung Korea Quantbox(Core) profile at Glean. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Glean Software Engineer

## Insights on the Selection Process
Direct Shortlisting based on Resume. 3 Rounds of coding interview

##  Preparation Resources
I mainly focused on Leetcode to solve problems. Interviewbit is yet another resource, but I did not like its Interface. I also regularly gave P-club archive contests, which significantly increased my overall confidence. For the quant role, I did 50 CP, puzzle quant and some Heard on the Street.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Don’t quit. There will be times when you might feel that all this is useless, and I’ll be happy with an internship that pays less, but don’t let those thoughts take over. Consistency is everything, and even if you feel demotivated, you must not give up. Prepare in groups. This is indeed a double-edged sword. It might favour you or not, but it totally depends on you. But I feel that if you know what your peers are doing, you tend to feel motivated towards your goal. Talk to seniors. We are always there to help and guide you. So whenever you feel demotivated, just call any of your seniors, and they will give you the right advice. Believe me, we have already gone through what you are going through, so we can understand your situation much better.
