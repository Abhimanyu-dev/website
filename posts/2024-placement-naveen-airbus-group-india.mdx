## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
N.A.

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
Test followed by technical interview and HR round

##  Insights on the interview process
1- I was asked about my internship project in NAL. They further discussed about my M.Tech. thesis. 2- only important thing is that you should be well versed with all projects that you are mentioning in your resume. Then, they asked very basic questions from flight mechanics. 3- Behaviour wise, interviewers were very chill and it was a fun and relaxed conversation

## Sample Interview Questions? 
Most questions were from My thesis.So, it wont be of any help to you but subject question from flight mechanics were tell us difference about phugoid mode and short period mode; tell us about longitudional dynamic stability. So, main thing to draw from gere is to have basic conceptual knowledge of profile being applied. In HR round, all typical question about strength & weakness, why you want to be part of company, knowing about company, etc.

## Preparation Resources
I just used my Gate and class notes for test and technical round. For Mental ability, there are enuff online websites.

Nothing specific. Leave it to intelligence of student. May be what worked for me, don't works for you. All the best !!
