## Insights on the Selection Process
First, a coding test was administered online by Databricks. For someone who has answered a good number of interview questions, it would be simple. The range of Leet code-medium type problems was where the challenge lay. After that, three interviews took place. Two focused on answering and debating coding-related problems. They posed a medium-difficulty Leet code coding question during the first interview session. In the second round, the difficulty of the questions was raised to a level somewhat above that of the Leetcode hard questions. The last round consisted of a technical portion as well as an HR round

##  Preparation Resources
I attempted most of the Code forces contests, solved almost all the Interview bit problems and then moved to solve Leet code questions (Leet code preferrable if you have time left after solving Interview bit)
