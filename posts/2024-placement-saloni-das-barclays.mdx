I am Saloni Das, Btech from the department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering. Roll No. - 200845, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Barclays Graduate Analyst. Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Accenture – consultant Publicis Sapient – Data Scientist ( I don’t remember others, sorry)

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
Resume Shortlist Aptitude Assessment Interview

##  Insights on the interview process
Barclays  It was a 2 rounds process. In the first round, focus was on things mentioned in the resume including questions from technical skills as per in resume ( in my case, they asked questions from SQL ). Since they were hiring for retail, so they asked related case study also. Second round was a case study round. They gave printed case study and I had to do the calculations and provide solutions to the problem. It was related to banking only. Accenture This was also 2 rounds. Both rounds were focused on resume and situation based questions. They wanted to know more about my personality and decision making skills in various situtaions.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1) SQL questions 2) Why Barclays? And why non core 3) Case study 4) Resume based

## Preparation Resources
I mostly used YouTube videos for SQL and hackerrank for practicing questions. For other concepts as well, I used random resources from the internet which suited my pace and learning ability. ( I am sorry but I can’t recall any specific websites or videos for that matter)

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
1) CPI matters a lot atleast for shortlisting for tests. If you are not shortlisted for tests, then there is no point. 2) Prepare a story of your resume, that connects all the projects and work you have done to you aim and motivation to joining that company. This shows your sincerity towards the role. 3) DO practice HR questions as well. They may seem insignificant but there is a certain way to answer them, which can really turn the course of your interview. 4) Include key words in the resume related to different expected roles. Get it verified by as many seniors as possible. 5) Interviewers don’t expect you to know everything, but are more focused on whether you can justify what you have done over the years. So ensure you are thorough with the things mentioned in resume 6) Technical questions can be asked in any format, so be prepared for solving on spot questions 7) Finally, be confident, they may try to confuse you or grill you, but you have to be confident to get by. Best of luck!!
