Aryash Pateriya Roll No 190189 BT (Double major) - CE and CSE, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Company - Sprinklr Profile - Product Engineer. Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1.Nk Securities - Quant Developer and Quant Researcher 2.Deutsche Bank - Analyst (IB) 3.Capital One - Business Analyst and Software Developer 4.Microsoft - Software Developer 5.Stripe - Software Developer

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
1.Open to all 2.No resume shortlist 3.No GD 4.Test - It consists of 3 coding questions with mostly medium level difficulty (~CF 1300-1600). A person who almost solves all the questions gets shortlisted for the interview

##  Insights on the interview process
The interview was a nice experience. It consisted of four rounds, each round being an elimination. First 3 rounds were techical comprising mostly of programming questions and a few small puzzles along with questions from OS and resume. First two rounds were a bit relaxed with questions asked by seniors who probably had 2-3 years in experience. The third round was taken by vice president which was a bit longer and detailed. Last round is a hr round which is mostly to judge interest and skills. Always have a pre-info of the work done by the company

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1.Round 1 and 2 - Rotation of Red Black trees upon insertion, deletion and query, Process Scheduling algorithms and context switch, Resume based questions, Cherry 2.Round 3 - Possible algorithms of finding inversions in array, implementation of merge sort based idea with explanation, OS virtualization, page table, some SQL question (I refused to answer as I was not experienced

## Preparation Resources
1.Software Development - If you are starting early, then keep solving codeforces contests (live or virtual), try to push your rating to expert, but being specialist is okay. Use PClub’s test archives, they are very handy as they contain almost similar questions as in an actual test. You can solve leetcode/interviewBit in parallel but be aware of the time left for preparation. 2.OS - CS330 notes, Networks - CS425 notes (Not strictly mandatory) Quants and Banks - Xinfeng Zhou’s book and puzzledquant website, some questions will be present in both. The important thing is a solid base is probability and statistics (MSO201 is a good resource)

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
It is okay if you don't have a relevant intern or no intern at all. Just start early and be consistent. Please keep your 7th/9th sem a bit relaxed, don't infuse unnecessary courses. Also if you want to switch from the current field, this is the chance. Companies will hire you on the basis of your skills (mostly, but yes, sometimes cpi and department advantage is present). Another thing, never lie that you know certain stuff you've mentioned in the resume and then act like you can't recall. Just say I don't have any experience with that thing. Since I have spent 5 years here, on a reality check side, yes, cpi matters, but can be balanced with skills and achievements. Never think of yourself being underconfident, people often pull off incredible stuff on the D-day. Be calm and composed, and you've got this! All the best!
