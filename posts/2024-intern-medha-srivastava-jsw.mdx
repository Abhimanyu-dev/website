Medha Srivastava, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Medha Srivastava 210603 Mechanical engineering -Btech student  will do
 summer internship in JSW’s SIP Intern profile at JSW. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Nestle(for round 1) ITC (for GD ) Fin mechanics Oracle JLR Dr Reddy (1 st round cleared )

## Insights on the Selection Process
The test comprised two sections- the first focused on core concepts(it was not also too much ) , while the second emphasized analytical skills. Notably, coding questions were absent. Instead, the emphasis was on assessing practical application knowledge, particularly pertaining to the operation of thermal power plants. This approach aimed to gauge candidates&#39; ability to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios. Question were related to Data Interpretation . statistics , probability .

## Insights on the Interview Process
JSW&#39;s shortlist wasn&#39;t extensive. My interview lasted nearly 25 minutes. I had thoroughly prepared for the AMX and was questioned about both my resume and projects.

## Sample Interview Questions
My interviewer persistently challenged me to explain why I was opting for JSW (core) over SDE (Software Development Engineer). In reality, they sought someone genuinely interested in their company and its core operations How does a thermal power plant work? Explain the engine cycle and pressure cycle. AME FULL FORM Questions were also about my core projects.

##  Preparation Resources
I also prepared for sde . Coding ninja Youtube- striver

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Core – thermo important mechanics Resume unnecssary things don’t wrrite and don’t cluster Surge actually helpful – work benefit For core- read thermodynamics and mechanics things. Avoid overloading your resume with unnecessary details; it can have a negative impact during interviews. I successfully completed my SURGE and it genuinely proved beneficial for me.
