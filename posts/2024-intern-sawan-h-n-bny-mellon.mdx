## Insights on the Selection Process
There were 3 rounds , 2 technical and one HR. In first half the interviewer mainly asked about projects on resume and asked me to explain the project on federated learning. After this discussion he told me to write a code to build a binary tree and find its height which was pretty easy , after that he modified few parts of code and asked me to identify why the code gave segmentation faults and asked why does segmentation fault occur. After this he asked about object oriented programming.I explained all the concepts , after which he asked me to code an example for polymorphism in whichever language I was comfortable with. 2nd round was also a technical round where he first he asked about data types.
