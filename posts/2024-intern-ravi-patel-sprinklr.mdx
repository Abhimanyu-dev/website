##  Preparation Resources
Preparation strategy
I started my preparation for internship drive during summer. I also made a rough draft of my
resume to see where I needed to improve. For coding part, participated in almost every contest
on Codechef &amp; Codeforces during summers. Followed software roadmap &amp; InterviewBit to
practice coding questions. Also solved Puzzles &amp; Probability ques from below mentioned
resources. Resources:
1. Competitive Coding (Codeforces &amp; Codechef)
2. DSA (Geeks for Geeks – for theory; Leetcode &amp; InterviewBit – for practice)
3. Software Roadmap: https://spo.iitk.ac.in/assets/Roadmap_SDE.pdf

5. Puzzles: https://brainstellar.com/puzzles

roles)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
For DSA prep, solve each &amp; every question of InterviewBit (atleast 2 times both Programming
&amp; Puzzles section). Sometimes questions are directly asked (or with small variation) from
here.
Don’t wait till the last minute to make your resume. Prepare thoroughly (with proper
reasoning) what you have written in it. You can expect questions like why this project, why low
CPI, why this POR etc.
All the Best!
