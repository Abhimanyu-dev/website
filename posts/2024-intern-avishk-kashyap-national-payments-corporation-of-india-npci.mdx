 summer internship in Companies National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) Intern Profiles Data Science Intern profile at National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:

## Insights on the Selection Process
1 round only(45min)- 1.HR( questions about what NPCI does and mention a new product which they have launched) 2. Explain a project which was based on Machine Learning and explain basic ML concepts and algorithms 3. DSA question( 2 pointer approach) 4. Explain Object Oriented Programming Structure(OOPS) in Java

## Insights on the Interview Process
1. Always try to attend the Pre-placement talk of companies so that you know what they stand for and what services they offer. Even if you miss the talk, research about the company’s vision, mission and services online. 2. DSA questions in all the companies I was shortlisted in were mostly from InterviewBit, which I had practiced during the summer break. Try to practise as much as possible from InterviewBit , and you will be well prepared to tackle mostly all problems given in SDE interviews. 3. Be thorough with your resume. You should know exactly what you have written in it and how to explain it. Prepare beforehand what you will say for each point in your resume, and you will be much more confident during any interview ;)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
The most important lesson that I learnt during the internship season was to never let a rejection get into your head and never give up. You are more important than any company or profile, so even if you get rejected by a company in which you had high hopes of getting selected, always remember that it is never your loss provided you gave your best. You will eventually get what you deserve and that will be much better than you could imagine. So never give up and always remember you will never be defined with your intern company or profile, but by who you are as a person even without it ;) Confidence is key. Even if you know getting into a certain company is tough, still walk into the interview with your head held up high, you know never know what great things you have in store;)
