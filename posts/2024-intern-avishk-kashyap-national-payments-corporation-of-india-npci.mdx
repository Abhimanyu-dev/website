## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
The most important lesson that I learnt during the internship season was to never let a rejection get into your head and never give up. You are more important than any company or profile, so even if you get rejected by a company in which you had high hopes of getting selected, always remember that it is never your loss provided you gave your best. You will eventually get what you deserve and that will be much better than you could imagine. So never give up and always remember you will never be defined with your intern company or profile, but by who you are as a person even without it ;) Confidence is key. Even if you know getting into a certain company is tough, still walk into the interview with your head held up high, you know never know what great things you have in store;)
