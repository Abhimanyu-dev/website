1. Online Assessment It consists of a single coding problem that is based on a real-world situation. The problem statement was lengthy and complex to understand but the logic was easy and based on basic implementation. The problem is multipart with each part’s solution building upon the previous one.

##  Insights on the interview process
1. Integration Round This round was a feature implementation round in which a basic task will be given and later complex logic will asked after each variation is solved. o The correctness of the code matters a lot in this round as code for each implementation will be executed and checked for expected outcome. o They expect at least 3 subparts of the task to be solved (according to my interviewer) o Googling is allowed in this round o It is strictly a 45 min round so speed and googling skills matter.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1. Bug Squash(Bug fixing) In this round, a github repository for a codebase will be provided, which will have some errors. You will have to clone the repository into your local system and then try to fix the errors. Tests are provided to help you find the bugs. o They do not expect you to fix the all errors but the process and being vocal will be taken into account. o Being vocal in this round is very important as you should be able to explain the about any function encountered while solving the errors and along the process you are following. o You should use the debugging techniques and tools for your language of choice. o Googling is allowed in this round but you will not be allowed to google the specific issue but anything about the language you are using.
