insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1. Texas Instruments (Analog Role) 2. NoBroker (Business Strategy Intern) 3. Qualcomm (Hardware Intern) 4. Samsung Research (Developer Role)

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. For Texas Instruments, the Analog part was quite easy and based on whatever we studied by the end of 4 th sem, and for the digital part, it was mostly based on signals, modulation, and problems based on time and frequency domain. 2. The test of NoBroker is easy to crack with just simple mental ability questions. 3. For Qualcomm, the questions are a bit easier, all from whatever has been covered. The major portion was solving circuits, logic gates, inverters, etc. 4. For Samsung Research, time is the key for cracking the test and rest we were given 3 simple DSA-based questions which you can solve within 45-50min with a basic understanding of DSA (Question type CP)

##  Preparation Resources
You should be able to solve the first 3 questions of CodeForces Div.2 Round for the Samsung Test and for others just brush up on whatever you have learned in your past two years and also be updated with whatever is taught recently as somehow they know our syllabus and curriculum too.
