Rahul Jha, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Name Rahul Jha Roll No.  210802 Branch MTH Programme BS Any other things you will like to tell us about yourself (Optional) Coordinator, PClub will do
 summer internship in Goldman Sachs(Analyst) profile at Goldman Sachs. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1. Optiver (Trader, Researcher) 2. Trexquant (Researcher) 3. Goldman Sachs (Analyst) 4. McKinsey (Analyst)

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Optiver Based on Optiver’s proprietary tests and a market making game. The test was only open to MTH, CS, EE, SDS. Market making game was a one-on-one interview with a trader. Cannot really prepare for Optiver, just have a calm head and please attempt the test well rested. There were two interview rounds, HR and Technical. The technical round is again composed of various Market making games. 2. Trexquant Was open to everyone with a CPI more than 8, was based on a take home test. The interview consisted of questions on the test and very simple (think 3-sum) leetcode problems. 3. Goldman Shortlisting based on some combination of Test and CPI. The interviews for the quant role consisted solely of Puzzles. I was asked stats theory but they were not fussy about it. Usually has 3-4 rounds of interview. 4. McKinsey Shortlisting based on CPI, PoRs. I am not really sure about it because I did not prepare for consulting roles.

##  Preparation Resources
Arithmetic BrainStellar 50 CP

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Software Leetcode/Interviewbit is NOT ENOUGH. It helps in the interviews, but shortlisting tests are usually more tuned to CF contests. Do not rely solely on leetcode/IB. Quant Discrete math, probability puzzles, intermediate coding skills. Consulting Lol.
