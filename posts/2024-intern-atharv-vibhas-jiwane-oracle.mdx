Atharv vibhas jiwane, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Name: Atharv Jiwane
Roll No. : 210230
Branch: Mechanical Engineering
Programme: B. Tech. will do
 summer internship in Oracle(Software resp.) profile at Oracle. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1. ITC - KITES Summer
Intern (Core)
2. Oracle - App.
Dev./PDO Intern
(Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
ITC : Application form -&gt; Test(?) -&gt; Shortlist -&gt; Group Discussion -&gt;
Shortlist -&gt; 2 rounds of Interviews.
• Lengthy form, I vaguely remember giving some sort of skill-
assessment test which was gamified.
• Group Discussion was based on the same question that was given
by ITC last year.
• 1st round of Interview was based on some questions related to
projects and not-very-deep theoretical questions related to core
mechanical course like thermodynamics, dynamics and fluids.
• Interview panel consisted of a technical interviewer (IITK alum) and an
HR interviewer.
• Some family background and candidate background questions.
• I would say that they were looking for someone with more project/work
experience in the core field.
• For core questions, revise basic concepts in thermodynamics like
plots, engines, pumps, refrigerator, etc and dynamics and fluids like
boundary layer, evaporation, etc.
• Very few questions related to team management/ leadership questions
related to the PORs that I had mentioned.
• Did not make it to the second round of interviews.

Oracle : Application Form -&gt; Coding Test -&gt; Shortlist -&gt; 4 rounds of
Interviews
• Nominal form
• The coding round was held offline in a lecture hall and was not
proctored on the platform. There were 3 questions of increasing
difficulty. The first two questions were of medium difficulty and the last
one was hard.
• Interview shortlist comes for two positions - Server Tech and
Application Developer.
• First Round - Introduction -&gt; 1-2 generic medium-difficulty coding

questions to solve on paper and explain -&gt; I was lucky to be asked
some questions about my department related to 3D printing and
manufacturing based on the interviewers interest -&gt; I was asked about
my PORs
• Second Round - Was asked to pick my preferred data structure and
asked to generate a coding question and solve it on the spot.
• Third Round - Generic questions related to high-school probability and
statistics like histograms, medians and what is the chance that…?,
etc. Mainly, a SQL task related to performing one of the joins was
given (inner join as far as I remember).
• Fourth Round - HR round. Were you born and brought up in India? Do
you want to go for higher studies? Are you an Indian citizen?

##  Preparation Resources
Listed above.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
• Revise your projects well, learn to describe your project experience using the
S.T.A.R. (Story/Background. Task/Goal. Approach. Result/Outcome) approach. A
good background story always helps!
• Review the tech stack that the company prefers. Ask seniors if the company asks
questions about specific things for eg. Oracle questioned candidates about SQL
apart from DSA.
• Review requirements listed by the company, ask seniors for the type of questions
that the company asks etc.
• Don’t underestimate the importance of InterviewBit in your preparation.
• Prepare your resume thoroughly. You should be able to describe and defend every
line of your resume.
• Don’t skip to the solution if you are stuck on a problem on LeetCode/ InterviewBit.
Instead, persist for a while and try to figure the logic on your own. This has a
propelling impact on your preparation.
