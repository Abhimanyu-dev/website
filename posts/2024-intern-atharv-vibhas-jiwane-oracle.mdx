Atharv vibhas jiwane, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Name- Atharv Jiwane Roll No. - 210230 Branch- Mechanical Engineering Programme- B. Tech. student  will do
 summer internship in Oracle(Software resp.) profile at Oracle. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1. ITC - KITES Summer Intern (Core) 2. Oracle - App. Dev./PDO Intern (Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
ITC - Application form -&gt; Test(?) -&gt; Shortlist -&gt; Group Discussion -&gt; Shortlist -&gt; 2 rounds of Interviews. • Lengthy form, I vaguely remember giving some sort of skill- assessment test which was gamified. • Group Discussion was based on the same question that was given by ITC last year. • 1st round of Interview was based on some questions related to projects and not-very-deep theoretical questions related to core mechanical course like thermodynamics, dynamics and fluids. • Interview panel consisted of a technical interviewer (IITK alum) and an HR interviewer. • Some family background and candidate background questions. • I would say that they were looking for someone with more project/work experience in the core field. • For core questions, revise basic concepts in thermodynamics like plots, engines, pumps, refrigerator, etc and dynamics and fluids like boundary layer, evaporation, etc. • Very few questions related to team management/ leadership questions related to the PORs that I had mentioned. • Did not make it to the second round of interviews. Oracle - Application Form -&gt; Coding Test -&gt; Shortlist -&gt; 4 rounds of Interviews • Nominal form • The coding round was held offline in a lecture hall and was not proctored on the platform. There were 3 questions of increasing difficulty. The first two questions were of medium difficulty and the last one was hard. • Interview shortlist comes for two positions - Server Tech and Application Developer. • First Round - Introduction -&gt; 1-2 generic medium-difficulty coding questions to solve on paper and explain -&gt; I was lucky to be asked some questions about my department related to 3D printing and manufacturing based on the interviewers interest -&gt; I was asked about my PORs • Second Round - Was asked to pick my preferred data structure and asked to generate a coding question and solve it on the spot. • Third Round - Generic questions related to high-school probability and statistics like histograms, medians and what is the chance that…?, etc. Mainly, a SQL task related to performing one of the joins was given (inner join as far as I remember). • Fourth Round - HR round. Were you born and brought up in India? Do you want to go for higher studies? Are you an Indian citizen?

## Insights on the Interview Process
Core Companies Revise course content well before your interview. • Prepare for group discussions by partaking in mocks conducted by AnC and otherwise conduct some amongst your friends for better practice. • Be polite and confident, allow people to speak, do not interrupt anybody. If you start speaking along with somebody else, step back and reserve your spot after the present speaker. • Do not repeat what somebody else has already said. Be present in the conversation and if you want to, acknowledge and appreciate that someone else has already made this point before and add on to that point. • Commencing the discussion by laying out a broad plan of action or flow, moderating the discussion and concluding the discussion will earn you cookie points. • Thermodynamics - Sketch the plot of a Rankine/Carnot/Otto/Brayton cycle, efficiency formulas, 2/4-stroke engine functions, etc • Fluids - boundary layer separation criterion, evaporation • Dynamics - How to estimate the velocity output of a robotic arm given the forces on applied on the arm. • Will ask you detailed questions on your project. Prepare according to STAR approach and be ready to answer follow up questions. • If you do list it down, you will be asked rigorous technical questions pertaining to your involvement in a SnT club or team. Software Companies • Revise InterviewBit before going to the Interview. • Cover all the popular medium and some hard questions pertaining to every topic especially graphs, trees, lists and arrays. • Learn all the popular algorithms and how to write, at least, the main block of code of the algorithm. • You should know how to dry run your code and explain it to another person. • Practice thinking out loud and writing your solutions visually on paper. • For DSA preparation, choose either Leetcode or InterviewBit. I prefer InterviewBit due to its lovely bucketing of questions topic-wise and overall point-based approach to learning DSA. • Try to cover either of the two platforms well before the Internship season starts and keep revising problems. • Attempt contests on Codeforces or similar platforms, a good rating on these platforms speaks volumes about your ability. • Attempt the previous Absolver contests offered by PClub and partake in the ones that they conduct throughout the summers. • Do • Learn SQL, basics + types of join from short YouTube tutorials. Should take a few hours at max. • For DSA, Striver’s or Luv’s playlist is standard. • If you are stuck on specific InterviewBit/LeetCode questions, you should find some variant of the question on Google or YouTube.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
• Revise your projects well, learn to describe your project experience using the S.T.A.R. (Story/Background. Task/Goal. Approach. Result/Outcome) approach. A good background story always helps! • Review the tech stack that the company prefers. Ask seniors if the company asks questions about specific things for eg. Oracle questioned candidates about SQL apart from DSA. • Review requirements listed by the company, ask seniors for the type of questions that the company asks etc. • Don’t underestimate the importance of InterviewBit in your preparation. • Prepare your resume thoroughly. You should be able to describe and defend every line of your resume. • Don’t skip to the solution if you are stuck on a problem on LeetCode/ InterviewBit. Instead, persist for a while and try to figure the logic on your own. This has a propelling impact on your preparation.
