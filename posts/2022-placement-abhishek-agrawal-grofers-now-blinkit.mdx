2. One Round Interview which went for 45 minutes covering technical, product and HR Questions
Details are here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6aDyUtsu3EBDSyBqiKH6998OVZpyc0BM2Awy2sNC3g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6aDyUtsu3EBDSyBqiKH6998OVZpyc0BM2Awy2sNC3g/edit?usp=sharing)


Three insights:
1. The whole process before the interview as well as the interviews are exhausting, physically as well as mentally. Have a support system with you (I had my family) and avoid distractions which might come in the form of any emotional or informational distress, during the process. Keep yourself healthy.

2. Be yourself, with dress or coiffure, with knowledge, with language. Make your own plan, your goals and execute. Prepare for the placements keeping in mind that these are almost once in a lifetime opportunity. But also relax yourself as the placements are not the only opportunity in life.

3. Enter the interview process with confidence and a little smile. Greet the interviewers, that usually breaks the ice. If you can know the background of your interviewer, you might be able to make little tweaks in your conversation (But do this only when you have your fundamental knowledge solid. Otherwise, instead of being smart, you will look sciolist).

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
# Specific Profiles:

1. For SDE: Start as early as possible. If you are novice, one year preparation will make you at par with what is required for the roles. Ample resources are there, so a plan is needed to optimize them.

2. For Chemical Engineering Core: Refresh your fundamentals. The Heat Transfer, Mass Transfer, Fluids, Chemical Process Industries are the core subjects you need to be strong at.

3. For PM: Follow the doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6aDyUtsu3EBDSyBqiKH6998OVZpyc0BM2Awy2sNC3g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6aDyUtsu3EBDSyBqiKH6998OVZpyc0BM2Awy2sNC3g/edit?usp=sharing)

4. For Consultancy: Prepare all type of cases, read the books by IITB, IITM, IIM etc. Here also, ample resources are already available. You just need to make a plan and practice.

# General:
1. Collect resources -> Plan -> Prepare -> Practice -> Practice -> Perform
2. Give as many mocks as possible before the interviews.
3. Your resume is the pitch for you. Make it yours and make it strong. Attach stories to it for the interviews. Prepare it in and out.
4. Prepare personalized HR questions beforehand. Impromptu attempt for HR question is only safe if you have prepared the standard HR questions well.
5. एकै साधे सब सधै, सब साधै सब जाय : Don’t run for all the profiles, choose few and master them.

Conclusion: Madness is everywhere. Find Methods in that Madness.
