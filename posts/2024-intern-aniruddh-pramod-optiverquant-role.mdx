Aniruddh Pramod, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Aniruddh Pramod student  will do
 summer internship in Optiver - Trading profile at Optiver(Quant Role). Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver - Trading

## Insights on the Selection Process
Round 1- We played a series of games, testing various skills. 80 in 8 is probably the most popular one, based on mental math. Other games tested things like reaction times, memory, logical reasoning etc. If you wanted to apply for the SDE role you also had to answer a separate test for it. Round 2- We were informed that it would be a GD round but it was changed into an online interview. Questions were based on guesstimates and probability primarily. We also played a market making game based on a doc that was shared right before this round. Round 3 (Day 1)- There were 3 rounds of interviews, 2 technical and 1 HR, the order varied between candidates. The technical round still focused on probability questions and the market making game. Rough paper was not allowed for any of the rounds, all calculations had to be done in your head.

## Insights on the Interview Process
Optiver values the unpredictability of its selection process as far as I can see. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the specific formats of its selection process change, since I think they prefer if people don’t prepare for it and face the questions naturally with their own intuition. As a lucky consequence perhaps it does end up being a much more refreshing and fair selection process compared to a lot of other companies.

## Sample Interview Questions
You can practice 80 in 8 online by searching for it. The other games of the first test cannot be practiced anywhere as far as I’m aware. Sample Questions from the Interview – Q1) How much money could you fit into my house? (Guesstimate) Q2) Throw a dice 100 times, sum up the numbers that come up but for every two 3’s you get, remove one 6. What is the expected value of the sum? (Probability)

##  Preparation Resources
InterviewBit + Striver for DSA, Brainstellar for Probability Puzzles, MSO201 for Probability Basics

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Consistent preparation throughout the summer is single-handedly the most important thing you can do to increase your chances of getting selected. Stick to one set of resources, and do them religiously till you feel like you can recall questions as soon as you see them. It is probably one of the most stressful times that you will ever face on campus, so try to keep your mental health in check while you prepare. It is extremely easy to spiral into negative thoughts if you have a bad day, or when you don’t get shortlists even after giving your best efforts, but remember that you only need that one success, so try to ignore all the external factors and do whatever you can to help your case.
