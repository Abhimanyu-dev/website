Aniruddh Pramod, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Aniruddh Pramod will do
 summer internship in Optiver - Trading profile at Optiver(Quant Role). Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver - Trading

## Insights on the Selection Process
Round 1: We played a series of games, testing various skills. 80 in 8 is
probably the most popular one, based on mental math. Other games
tested things like reaction times, memory, logical reasoning etc. If you
wanted to apply for the SDE role you also had to answer a separate test
for it.
Round 2: We were informed that it would be a GD round but it was
changed into an online interview. Questions were based on
guesstimates and probability primarily. We also played a market making
game based on a doc that was shared right before this round.
Round 3 (Day 1): There were 3 rounds of interviews, 2 technical and 1
HR, the order varied between candidates. The technical round still
focused on probability questions and the market making game. Rough
paper was not allowed for any of the rounds, all calculations had to be
done in your head.

##  Preparation Resources
InterviewBit + Striver for DSA, Brainstellar for Probability Puzzles, MSO201 for Probability
Basics

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Consistent preparation throughout the summer is single-handedly the most important thing
you can do to increase your chances of getting selected. Stick to one set of resources, and do
them religiously till you feel like you can recall questions as soon as you see them. It is
probably one of the most stressful times that you will ever face on campus, so try to keep your
mental health in check while you prepare. It is extremely easy to spiral into negative thoughts
if you have a bad day, or when you don’t get shortlists even after giving your best efforts, but
remember that you only need that one success, so try to ignore all the external factors and do
whatever you can to help your case.
