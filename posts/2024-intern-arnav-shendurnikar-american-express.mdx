## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Start your preparation early. Don’t get dejected when you rare not able to solve questions specially coding problems. In the interview be active and try to converse with your interviewer, if there was something that I was not able to solve then I would ask the interviewer for hints. One thing more is that to have a short story around the points in your resume, because the interviewer will grill you on your resume. There should be a flow in your resume, like how did you get there, even in projects, why did you do that project. So, you should have some reason for that and things should feel natural. Start reading books, it will increase your reading speed &amp; understand better and will help in solving analytics questions because they will give you 20 questions for about 30-45mins. Have a study partner with you to prepare so you do not lose your motivation.
