Geetika, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in nan will do

insights.

## Insights on the Selection Process
The first step in the selection process was an online assessment. It comprised of 3 questions based on DSA. At least 2-2.5 questions were required to be solved for getting shortlisted. Also, a shortlist in the Uber She++ test helps a lot. This was followed by release of shortlist and interview.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Choose your priority order beforehand. I missed some important interviews. I thought I would get shortlisted in quadeye because my interview went very well and my CPI was good, but clearly that was not the case, that’s why I went to Uber’s interview (I had choices like Millenium and trexquant). Take actions considering the worst possible scenarios in mind. Also prepare for one level higher than what you are targeting, at least in my case my performance decreased significantly because of stress. I practiced a lot of hard questions that helped me survive Intern season day1. Get a good sleep. I remember I was unable the sleep the night before day1 )
