nan

## Insights on the Selection Process
They had an online coding assessment test. The questions were not too
 difficult. The selection for interviews was based on performance in the
 coding test and CPI. There were 2 technical interviews where they
 asked first moderate and then a little difficult question. Lastly there was
 also an HR round.

##  Preparation Resources
Used interviewbit and codeforces contests for coding. The PClub archive contests are also very
 helpful for preparing for the type of questions asked by the companies.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
CPI will also matter but whatever done is done, focus on what is in your hands right now and
 try to work and improve that.
 Start early, and try to do one resource properly either you do interviewbit or leet code.
 Try to do coding with your friends or in groups. It will keep you motivated for doing questions.
 Also try the mock interviews with your friends to know how you perform and speak in tense
 situations.
