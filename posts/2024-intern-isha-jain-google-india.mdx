## Insights on the Selection Process
In Google there were 2 rounds both based on DSA, I was given question and had to write the code on google sheet. In Microsoft, in the first round DSA based question was asked. Next round is based on the resume. Projects are asked in detail. In ITC, first an application form had to be filled that has mostly questions on our projects done and questions where you showed your leadership skills. Enough time is given to fill the application form. Then a group discussion is there, after qualifying that interview is taken. In HUL, similar to ITC, an application form has to be filled, Followed by this an online interview and then an offline interview.

##  Preparation Resources

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Interviewbit for DSA Brainstellar for Puzzles Complete as many questions as possible from interviewbit and also revise the questions time to time. While doing questions, don’t spend a lot of time on a single question. If you don’t get the clue, just look for the solutions and move to another question. In HUL and ITC, group discussions are important.
