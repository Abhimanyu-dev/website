## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Study well…I guess. You are in an IIT, you know the drill. Study with a curiosity and study with an openness; try to make it a process that is less mechanical and more fun. Solve cases, solve guesstimates, solve puzzles as much as possible. Go through your projects thoroughly and stand in front of a mirror acting like your own interviewer. Take a second to distance yourself from your own head and act like you have no idea about who you are and will judge yourself purely from this resume in your hand. Ask every possible question you can about your resume and find where you make errors. Revise and remake your project details and keep going till you are sure you won’t stutter. Do this as soon as possible, hopefully before your endsems. You this alone first and then with friends and experienced seniors. Remember to switch between being your greatest critic to your own best friend during placement preparation. Identify your shortcomings when you speak up and hype up yourself when you are doing well. Also, a word of advice- the world doesn’t end if you don’t get placed. There will be a world out there ready to embrace you and you will fit in somewhere when the time comes. Having known this, give every interview and test your very best.
