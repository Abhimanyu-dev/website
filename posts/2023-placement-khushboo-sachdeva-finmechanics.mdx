## Insights on the Selection Process
It was quite wholesome, I was tested on three angles : Maths, Finance & Coding. There were2 rounds of interviews. First one was purely technical, 2 people in panel - One was thefounder and other was Associate Consultant. I was asked a Brainstellar puzzle, somequestions on python (my preferred language) and finance questions related to projects on myresume which mainly included Accounting & options. Besides that, they also asked aboutwhat the company does and surprisingly no candidate was able to answer this question fully. Iattended the pre placement talk and hence was able to answer, the interviewers were quitehappy (minor thing but got bonus points). Second round was more of an HR round where mypanel consisted of 8 people expecting you to get intimidated. They mainly talked about somequestions based on my resume, making situations out of it. Also, I was questioned about myadaptability if I had to code since I was more interested in Finance & Consulting. They alsomake you fill an HR form with the test, on which you can be questioned in the interview.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Try not to panic in any situation - it's 70-80% about how confident you are and the wayyou conduct yourself, rest depends on your technical soundness.● You can never prepare with 100% resources, just select what you find useful andcomplete that resource. Stick to limited resources and do them honestly.● Being a non-coder, it doesn't harm revisiting the basics and practicing problems beforeplacements, it helped me a lot. Do not completely ignore coding, it will always help!● Try to apply to maximum companies that come, interview experiences are valuableand will make you ready for the D-Day.
