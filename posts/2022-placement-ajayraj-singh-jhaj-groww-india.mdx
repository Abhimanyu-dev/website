## Insights on the Selection Process
Step 1: A problem statement was given and we had to submit a google doc as our soln
Step 2: Candidates were shortlisted on the basis of the aforementioned submission and resume both
Step 3: Interviews (2 or 3 rounds depending upon candidate)

Round 1, 20 Minutes

After a brief welcome greeting, we got down to the case immediately. No intro of the interviewer or me.

Question - RCA (Root Cause Analysis) case

Round 2 involved a case on Product sense for most of the candidates. I directly had the CEO round (Round 3) after my Round 1 interview so I didn’t have round 2.

Round 3, 20 Minutes - CEO round

Sample Interview Questions:

Round 1: RCA — users sign-up but don’t invest on Groww
Round 3:
Ques 1: Tell me something you have built - also asked me counter questions in between
Ques 2: How would you disrupt the cycle industry - again asked me counter questions in between

Books: (in order of priority)
1. Preparing For Product Interviews - Advaith Sridhar (Practice Cases as Mock interview when you feel fairly confident in that category of cases)
2. Decode and Conquer - Lewis C. Lin (Ch 1-10)
3. Swipe to Unlock (Read this like a novel, helps you to be confident about the tech used in apps - this also helps in both RCA cases and Design cases to varying extent)
4. Cracking the PM Interview - Gayle Laakmann - (Relevant Parts: Ch 10-15)
5. The Product Manager Interview - Lewis C. Lin with Teng Lu (Ch 6, 11-18)

2. Product Management Exercises: Master Your Product Manager Interview Skills

You can practice product cases (even individually) from above two resources and then compare your response to that given in the answer. Reading through the answers without giving them a genuine shot beforehand will NOT help you extract the value out of these resources.

Youtube channels:
1. Exponent
2. PM School

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1. When practising cases, try to keep your paperwork neat and structured

2. In the interviews, communication is very important. The interviewer should know at every step what you are trying to figure out/solve for. Be structured in your communication.

3. Start preparing early and practice a lot of product cases of each category (RCA/Guesstimate, Product Design/Improvement, Metrics). Practice is super important.

4. Carefully observe the products that you interact with frequently

Digital products: Amazon-Flipkart-Myntra, Zomato-Swiggy, Phonepe-Gpay-Paytm, Spotify-YTMusic, Ola-Uber, Whatsapp-Messenger-Telegram, FB-Insta, Youtube-Netflix-Hotstar, Airbnb, Chrome-Firefox Brave, Duolingo, Headspace, LinkedIn, Gdocs etc. — whichever of these you personally use. 

You should be aware of their user journeys, and the different features, scope for improvement, business model. Be a bit more conscious and observant when you use some of these products. Also observe the physical products that you use - headphones, cycle, electric kettle, school bag etc. and how can each of these be further improved.
