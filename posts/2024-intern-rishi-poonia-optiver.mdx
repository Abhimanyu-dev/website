Rishi Poonia, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Rishi Poonia Btech EE 210851 student  will do
 summer internship in Optiver profile at Optiver. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
"Optiver (Software) Sprinklr (Software) Microsoft (Software) "

## Insights on the Selection Process
For Microsoft and Sprinklr, there was 1 coding test, students were shortlisted for interview based on resume and the coding round. Optiver had an initial round with games and some MCQ questions based on CS fundamentals, the next coding test had 3 questions, 2 easy implementations based, 1 hard. Shortlisting was mostly based on performance, resume played little role. Microsoft had 2 interview rounds, one coding question was asked in each round. Sprinklr also had 2 coding rounds, some puzzles were also asked in 2nd round. Optiver had 3 interview rounds, 1 based on system design, 1 on algorithmic coding, and 1 HR round.

## Insights on the Interview Process
Do not target specific companies, the interview shortlisting process is very random (atleast from students’ perspective). Prepare for specific profiles rather than targeting companies. Stay calm on the interview day, if you do not have knowledge regarding any specific technology, gently ask the interviewer to explain it, companies don’t really expect interns to have prior knowledge. Contact respective seniors as soon as you get interview shortlist, their tips will help a lot. Practice on interviewbit/leetcode for coding tests, regularly give contests on Codeforces/Codechef/Atcoder. CPI also matters a lot, but your skills matter a lot more.

## Sample Interview Questions
A senior sent me these links for Microsoft interview, the questions will give you an idea about what to expect. https-//www.geeksforgeeks.org/microsofts-asked-interview-questions/ https-//www.geeksforgeeks.org/microsofts-most-frequently-asked-interview-questions-set-2/ The optiver interview questions were based on some coding questions where you have to keep track of a bunch of stuff, they will give you data and queries and you have to write functions that process the data and queries as fast as possible, a lot of maps and sets were used. Try to include the as much edge cases in your answer as possible, it is fine to ask for 5 minutes to properly frame your answer, try to be vocal about what you are thinking, that way the interviewer will be able to hint you to right direction if you are going wrong. Answering the coding question without taking a lot of hints almost guarantees that you will clear that interview round.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Regularly practice coding problems and puzzles, take feedback on your resume from as many seniors as possible. Discuss questions with your friends, try to gain different perspectives to each question. Make goals and don’t practice aimlessly. DP, Graphs and Binary Search are hot topics for coding questions. Cover the theory of OOPS, small questions on OOPS are asked in almost all interviews.
