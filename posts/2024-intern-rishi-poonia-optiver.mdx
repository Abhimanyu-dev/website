## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 

Regularly practice coding problems and puzzles, take feedback on your resume from as many seniors as possible. Discuss questions with your friends, try to gain different perspectives to each question. Make goals and don’t practice aimlessly. DP, Graphs and Binary Search are hot topics for coding questions. Cover the theory of OOPS, small questions on OOPS are asked in almost all interviews.
