Oracle profile at Atlassian. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Atlassian - SDE

## Insights on the Selection Process
There were two rounds, 1 technical and 1 HR round for Atlassian.
In the technical round the coding questions were asked and I had to
code the solution in some IDE and show the result, the interviewer was
interactive and helpful and was giving me relevant hints when asked.
In the HR round most of the questions were asked from my resume and
projects. They wanted to test whether I had the values necessary for
their company through my projects and IITK life.

##  Preparation Resources
Striver Sheet, Interview bit, GFG questions.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Stay consistent with you preparation. You have enough time if you stay consistent and
practice the questions and utilise the relevant resources for whatever profile you are
targetting. Don&#39;t lose hope in between, keep trying and keep learning.
