Shivansh Gupta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in My name is Shivansh Gupta (210986) and I am a third year undergraduate pursuing a majors
in Economic Sciences at IIT Kanpur. will do
 summer internship in I would be joining Bain and Company as an Associate Consulting Intern. profile at Bain & company. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
I had a shortlist for Summer Intern at Boston Consulting Group and at McKinsey &amp;Company
for Business Analyst Intern.

## Insights on the Selection Process
There was resume shortlisting and a screening test (included, aptitude and personality test
questions). Following the shortlist, senior and junior buddies were assigned, with whom I did

the buddy rounds (case studies), and then there was a dinner in Gurugram. Finally, interviews
were scheduled on the Day-1 of internship drive.

##  Preparation Resources
For Consulting, I prepared by learning from the video playlist by Aaditya Agarwal on YouTube,
and some random YouTube videos on few key concepts. Some CIC videos could also be
seen, to understand the process of how case studies are to be solved in an interview setting.

Practiced with peers from CIC, IIMA and SRCC Casebooks. Did cases with seniors.
Apart from Consulting profile, did coding practice on Interview Bit, and learned from YouTube
playlists. Aptitude and Puzzles were done from 50 challenging Problems in Prob and Stats,
Heard on the Street, Puzzled Quant and BrainStellar. Selected chapters from XinFeng Zhou’s
Quantitative Finance book could also be done for finance and probability.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
- Don’t rely on 1 profile only, diversify and prepare for 2-3 roles whole heartedly.
(Ensure that you don’t end up preparing for all too). Selection of roles is difficult, but
elimination is easier.
- Don’t see consulting as an alternative to coding. Preparation for consulting is to be
done from around shortlist time only, do coding and other prep before that.
- Don’t skip the interview tests of other companies, even if you think you’re gonna make
it in one.
- Relax, internships are just a phase, and not an end of the world, so don’t forget to
enjoy your summers too. Good friend circle is really helpful to survive the lonely,
scorching summers on campus (or at home), nd BT mt lo zyada ;-)
