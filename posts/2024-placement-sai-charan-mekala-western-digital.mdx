##  Insights on the interview process
1. It was an offline round in that he tested my knowledge about my branch and asked about things I mentioned in my resume, like I had to explain my projects in brief. It was of about 40 mins. 2. It was a core-technical round in which they focused on what they wanted, one of the interviewers focused on Thermodynamics and other one focused on Data Science. It was an online round which lasted for about 45min-1Hr. 3. This round was a Managerial round and after that they asked if I had any queries. 4. Last was the HR round.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1. In the 1st round I was asked to explain my resume and he asked what is FVM, how do you design a component on general basis. Like consider you are an engineer, you have to define your own task, design a component and manufacture it, so what are the steps that you will take. 2. He asked some questions based on thermodynamics and they were quite basic ones. 3. In the 2nd round, if you apply stress to a component why there will be generation of heat, and if there is heat the what is their implications in solder. 4. And few FVM questions like what are few things that you have to keep in mind during FVM analysis, how do you decide mesh number, if convergence is not achieved what would you do? 5. In data science he asked some basics questions like in a convolution layer what is a kernel, what are the different types of cost functions, if there are only few features and output variable are very large then is it a condition of over-fitting or under-fitting. 6. He asked some questions from pytorch and what are the functions you use to create convolution layer. 7. Coming to HR questions, he asked me to introduce myself and then asked about my family like what they are doing, also in my introductions I mentioned some soft skills so he asked me where I have used them in my life. At last he gave me a situation like I am team leader and 50% of team is agreeing with you and 50% is straight-away saying no so how will you deal with it.

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
1)Don’t panic even if the environment around you is negative because there’s high chance that you talk to someone and hear something negative. 2)Don’t lose you motivation to practice, just be disciplined for a month or two. I know things can get difficult but try to be consistent. Don’t be like you study 10 hours one day and then you’re exhausted for 3 days, rather study 5-6 hours a day for 4 days. 1)After you’re done with your practice it is important that you try to explain your work, just like in an interview, be it your code or even your past projects, that too in English because fluent communication is also quite important. 2)For your HR round, prepare for standard HR questions in advance and be confident in whatever you say. For Resume, keep it clean, avoid typing errors and grammatical mistakes as it creates a bad impression, also instead of spamming projects in your resume its better to mention those projects which are relevant for your profile and you’re confident in.
