* Be realistic in your answers
* Try to relate the question you are answering to a previous question you answered
* Write down what the interviewer is saying about themselves or company, they’ll
appreciate that, plus you’ll have something to build your question on, at the end of the
interview
* Ask the interviewer some check-in questions, keep giving mini summaries in long
answers and cases in order to keep the interview interactive.

Sample Interview Questions:

Product Case: Contact separately

* Tell me about yourself
* Strengths, Weakness
* Why should I hire you
