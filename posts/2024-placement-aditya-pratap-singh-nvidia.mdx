Aditya Pratap Singh from BT/EE dept. Roll no - 200053 Upcoming Formal Verification Engineer @ NVIDIA, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining NVIDIA Role - Formal Verification Engineer (ASIC Engineer). Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Microsoft (Software) Infurnia (Software) Navi (Software) NVIDIA (Core)

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
1. Resume Shortlisting 2. Technical Test - Objective having mostly analytical math problems and few questions on OS, basic programming and other computer fundamentals. The test was NOT difficult. Fundamental understanding of these topics is required. 3. Technical Interviews (3 rounds)

##  Insights on the interview process
1st roundQuestions on math puzzles, basic coding stuff, resume projects. I had a project related to Verilog; they were mostly interested in that. You should know your resume projects very well for this round. 2nd roundDiscussed about the job role. The interviewer wanted to know whether I am actually interested in the profile. Questions related to my resume. 3rd roundPretty much the same as the 2nd round. Discussed about the profile, job location. You are free to ask any questions from the interviewer.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1. Difficulties you faced in making your resume projects. 2. If it was a team project, how did you manage all the different tasks with other members. 3. Did you face any difficulty/disagreement working with the team; and if yes how did you resolve the situation.

## Preparation Resources
1)For coding/software profile I highly recommend solving the CSES problem set (covers many standard questions of varying difficulty). Once you are comfortable with the standard questions, start doing some difficult problems immediately. (Codeforces problem set, particularly problems having rating around 1800). 2)For NVIDIA core profile Courses on Computer Systems such as Computer Organization and Computer Architecture. Even though a very good understanding of CS220 is enough, having an inclination towards computer architecture will definitely be advantageous in the interview process. Some basic OS, OOPS, DBMS concepts (either through IITK courses or any youtube playlists)

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Dos 1. Make sure you know your resume very well. Having a project where you actually spent good time and effort would really help in the interviews. 2. BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF. You won’t need any outside help to clear the technical tests. Don’ts 1. Don’t just solve easy coding problems. It won’t help unless you make yourself comfortable with hard problems.
