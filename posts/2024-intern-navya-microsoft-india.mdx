## Insights on the Interview Process
1 st round was very technical, I think that the company brings a list of questions that they ask you continuously, and it’s fine if you are not able to answer some questions, its better to tell them directly rather than trying to waste their time by giving vague answers. In 2 nd round they gave a coding question which took about 20-25 minutes to solve. then they asked about my resume, extracurriculars, and some more technical questions in between.
