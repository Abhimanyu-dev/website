insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Bain and Company BCG

## Insights on the Selection Process
1)Resume Shortlist 2)Aptitude Test 3) 2 Rounds (In some cases 3) of case interviews

##  Preparation Resources
Theory 1) Aditya Agarwal’s playlist 2) IITB’s case interview cracked theory videos and mock videos. Practice Casebooks SRCC, IIMA, IITM, IITB Reach out to as many seniors as possible for mocks once you have practiced about 15 cases with your case group to get better feedback. The most important part of my preparation were the cases I practiced with my seniors and my case group. It is not just important to practice a case but also important to ask for feedback after the case and analyse the case later to look for ways to improve your approach.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
If you think that your resume is likely to get shortlisted, you can start practicing cases even before the shortlist is out. (Don’t wait for them to start the resume submission process; in our case, the process started pretty late, which gave very little time for people to practice. Even if the shortlist is not out, start practicing in the 1st week of July.). Try to make a small case group (mine had 3 people) and practice daily with them. (We practiced 1 case per person every day.). You can start with guesstimates, then practice profitability, then unconventional cases and then market entry cases. It is recommended to practice at least 10–15 cases in each of these categories. You can possibly have a look at pricing, growth, and mergers as well. Ensure that you have practiced your introduction multiple times. Try to mention things you wish to talk about in your introduction. (like your coolest internship, your POR, or your extracurricular activity)
