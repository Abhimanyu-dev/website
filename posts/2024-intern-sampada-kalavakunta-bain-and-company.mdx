## Insights on the Interview Process
Insights on the Selection Process About 20 people were shortlisted based on resumes. In order to get your resume shortlisted, three things that one can do are- 1) Try to have a diverse resume with 2-3 peaks (peaks essentially mean exceptional performance in various aspects like academics, research, professional experience, social work, PORS, sports, extracurricular activities, etc.). 2) Check out the resumes of your seniors to get a rough idea. 3) It is super important to start the process of making your resume early and getting it proofread by as many seniors as possible. (Don’t hesitate before texting a senior; most people are really helpful and will do it for you.) The aptitude test does not require any preparation as such. Our resume submission was around July 13th, and the shortlist was out on July 20th. After this, each one of us was allotted two buddies (they were current Bain employees from IIT Kanpur). My seniors had advised me to practice as many cases as possible with the junior buddy and practice at least one case with my senior buddy. These rounds are non-evaluative, so do not hesitate before reaching out to your buddy for a case. We also had a mock interview before the actual interview. This typically involves senior managers. My interview was about 30 minutes long and started with an introduce yourself question, followed by an e-commerce-related profitability case. On the final case interview day, I was asked about an unconventional market entry case in the first round. It was about 21 minutes long. The case was that a Canadian cement company wishes to enter India to launch a super app. What, according to you, should be the categories that it should operate in? In the second round, I was asked a mathematics word problem that included an elaborate set-up about trucks that deliver cement from one site to another, and I was asked to calculate the minimum number of trucks that are required for the job. The interview was about 12 minutes long. The key here is to try to stay as calm as possible and not be shy as far as asking for details. In the first round, I genuinely panicked because of the nature of the question. However, I began by asking the interviewer to tell me a little bit about what he meant by “super apps.” This gave me some breathing space and also gave direction to the interview. In the second round, though the question was lengthy, it was solvable (now that I look back). I quickly finished solving the question and communicated the wrong answer, 15 trucks. However, I luckily realised that my answer was wrong when I was explaining my procedure and quickly corrected it. Note that it is not about you being able to solve the question alone; it is also about how well you communicate during the interview and how receptive you are to feedback. Making mistakes is not a problem; however, how you handle the situation after that to fix it matters more.

## Sample Interview Questions

##  Preparation Resources
Theory 1) Aditya Agarwal’s playlist 2) IITB’s case interview cracked theory videos and mock videos. Practice Casebooks- SRCC, IIMA, IITM, IITB Reach out to as many seniors as possible for mocks once you have practiced about 15 cases with your case group to get better feedback. The most important part of my preparation were the cases I practiced with my seniors and my case group. It is not just important to practice a case but also important to ask for feedback after the case and analyse the case later to look for ways to improve your approach.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
If you think that your resume is likely to get shortlisted, you can start practicing cases even before the shortlist is out. (Don’t wait for them to start the resume submission process; in our case, the process started pretty late, which gave very little time for people to practice. Even if the shortlist is not out, start practicing in the 1st week of July.). Try to make a small case group (mine had 3 people) and practice daily with them. (We practiced 1 case per person every day.). You can start with guesstimates, then practice profitability, then unconventional cases and then market entry cases. It is recommended to practice at least 10–15 cases in each of these categories. You can possibly have a look at pricing, growth, and mergers as well. Ensure that you have practiced your introduction multiple times. Try to mention things you wish to talk about in your introduction. (like your coolest internship, your POR, or your extracurricular activity)
