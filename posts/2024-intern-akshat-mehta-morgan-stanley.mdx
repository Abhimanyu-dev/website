Akshat Mehta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Akshat Mehta Roll No. - 210092 Branch- ME Programme- B.Tech student  will do
 summer internship in Morgan Stanley (Strats & Quant) profile at Morgan Stanley. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Morgan Stanley (Strats & Quant) Goldman Sachs (Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
For Morgan Stanley, the selection process revolves around the online test gauging various skills like mental aptitude, coding, probability/stats. In interviews emphasis was given on puzzles and probability questions with a few questions on the resume. The students should be well versed with their projects and it is better if project topics are diverse. At Goldman Sachs, since the role was software based, the majority of the questions were DSA problems in addition to some resume based questions.

## Insights on the Interview Process
The interviews basically involve three rounds with two technical rounds and one HR round.

## Sample Interview Questions
Morgan Stanley - Multiple Puzzles and Probability questions were asked successively ranging in difficulty. A simple coding question on how to implement a minStack using two stacks was also asked. Goldman Sachs - One question revolved around Dijkstra’s algorithm for graph traversal by writing down its code on paper and what would happen if weights are equalized and then if they are chosen from two values. Some questions on arrays involving hashing and a medium DP question was also asked.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Set your goals and keep working...Luck is a manifestation of your hard work and it will be there when you need it..you have to give your best! Do DSA well, and do Puzzles and Probability problems in parallel so you are not bored doing one thing only. Prepare yourself comprehensively for the interviews and finally presentation is very important. Explain your thought process clearly and in a step by step manner trying that the interview flows smoothly like a conversation and not a QnA session. During preparation don’t get stuck on one question for too long, because time is limited and it might lead to frustration. Don’t leave a question for the next day, instead look at the solution if you can't get it and revise it after a few days. Also while doing DSA(InterviewBit) after learning a bit of arrays(searching and sorting) and linked lists, start with trees, graphs, dp and spend a lot of time on them because these topics are difficult and time consuming.
