## Insights on the Selection Process
For Morgan Stanley, the selection process revolves around the online
test gauging various skills like mental aptitude, coding, probability/stats.
In interviews emphasis was given on puzzles and probability questions
with a few questions on the resume. The students should be well
versed with their projects and it is better if project topics are diverse.
At Goldman Sachs, since the role was software based, the majority of
the questions were DSA problems in addition to some resume based
questions.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Set your goals and keep working...Luck is a manifestation of your hard work and it will be
there when you need it..you have to give your best!
Do DSA well, and do Puzzles and Probability problems in parallel so you are not bored doing
one thing only.
Prepare yourself comprehensively for the interviews and finally presentation is very important.
Explain your thought process clearly and in a step by step manner trying that the interview
flows smoothly like a conversation and not a QnA session.
During preparation don’t get stuck on one question for too long, because time is limited and it
might lead to frustration. Don’t leave a question for the next day, instead look at the solution if
you can't get it and revise it after a few days.
Also while doing DSA(InterviewBit) after learning a bit of arrays(searching and sorting) and
linked lists, start with trees, graphs, dp and spend a lot of time on them because these topics
are difficult and time consuming.
