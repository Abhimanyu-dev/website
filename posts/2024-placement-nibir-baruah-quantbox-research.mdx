Hi, my name is Nibir Baruah, 19807545. I am a BT-MT student in the department of Computer Science and Engineering. My interests mainly lie in parallel programming, computer architecture and operating systems. For my thesis project, I have been working on analysing and improving the performance of common filesystems like f2fs and ext4 on multi-device persistency configurations, mainly focusing on SSDs and HDDs., studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Quantbox Research - Core Engineering Analyst. Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1.Graviton (Software) 2.NK Securities (Software) 3.Google (SDE) 4.Squarepoint (Software)

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
1. Resume Shortlist 2.Online Test 3. Interview

##  Insights on the interview process
The interview process had 2 rounds. Round 1) This had both theoretical and programming components. For the theory part, I was asked advanced OOPS concepts, modern c++, parallel programming, concurrent data structures, cache concepts. Programming involved coding up some modern c++ data structure, using threads with and without locks to implement a solution for a problem. I was also asked to implement some functions using c++ templates. Round 2) This round was mainly theoretical. We had a very good discussion on hashing and different ways on improving it. Then there were some theoretical and programming questions on how memory can be used efficiently.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
N.A.

## Preparation Resources
1.Codeforces 2.leetcode 3.C++ books like Effective Modern c++ by Scott Meyers 4. learncpp.com, 5.cppnow and cppcon videos on youtube.

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Practice coding regularly on codeforces and leetcode. Keep your CGPA decent. I would recommend keeping it above 9. If you are preparing for systems role, you have to study separately for that. The core CS courses help a lot in this. Try to also do some projects in that area.
