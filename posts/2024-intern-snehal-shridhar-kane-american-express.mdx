## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Talk to seniors who have been selected in your company of interest. They can give you first hand experiences of their interviews and kind of questions asked Listen to the company’s PPT intently. It might help you in the HR questions asked in your interviews Once interview fixed, try to collect maximum info about the company’s business model, products, financial numbers etc Be familiar with general HR questions Articulate your thoughts well and think out aloud while solving puzzles and guesstimates. Know current basic numerals of Indian economy to answer guesstimates. Some more important points - Make a good resume with as much relevant projects as possible. Unlike consulting resumes, extracurriculars and PORs need not be very elaborate. Get your resume verified by as much seniors as possible. You might get mixed opinions, finally stick to what you find the best. You can target a specific company while making a specific domain resume. For analytics including projects which involve ML concepts is a big plus. Knowing SQL is a sweet spot. It is alright if you know just the basics. It is really easy and watching any Youtube video will give you a fair working idea. Have fair understanding of ML concepts to answer technical questions.
