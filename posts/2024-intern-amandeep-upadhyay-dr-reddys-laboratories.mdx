Amandeep Upadhyay, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Amandeep Upadhyay Roll No.- 210114 Branch- Electrical Engineering Programme- B.Tech Any other things you will like to tell us about yourself (Optional) My hobby is cricket and problem solving. My past involvements on the campus were- I was organiser in Techkriti and I mentored a project related to Autodesk. student  will do
 summer internship in Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories(Data Analyst) profile at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
I got selected for Data Analyst role in Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories. There were 4 companies and profiles for which I was shortlisted. 1. Texas Instruments, Core 2. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Data Analytics 3. Qualcomm, Hardware 4. Amazon, SDE

## Insights on the Selection Process
1)Resume shortlisting 2)Tests 3)Interviews

## Insights on the Interview Process
For Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Firstly, there was resume shortlisting (preferably Machine Learning based resumes were shortlisted) and CPI criteria, as far as I know was roughly above 7. Then there was a MCQ test which asks some theoretical questions from machine learning and deep learning concepts. 12 people were selected (for data analytics) for interview round. Interview was conducted in 2 rounds and 3 got selected. The timings of my interview were like that- half and hour for first round and 10 minutes for the second round. Similar is the case with Texas Instruments, resume shortlisting (above 7 is the CPI criteria) then test then interview. This company will test your knowledge on the courses like ESC201, ESO203. This company was offering 4 roles. It was 25-35 min online interview they were mainly asking core questions.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
I was more oriented towards getting a core job. Solely I was not preparing for this role. Those who are going for core, resources are very easily available nothing usually comes out of your course content. What you have to do is grasp your core concepts properly. Analog and Digital from ESC201. Sampling questions, practical laboratory-based questions, ESO203, these were most important things. For core prep last 15-20 days are more than enough. I was not majorly oriented towards prep of a Data scientist so I can’t really suggest resources for that, but I feel the machine learning concepts you learn while doing your course or any project are enough. For SDE prep I used youTube, Codechef and I was not a very good coder I started and did coding in 3-month time only. Again, because my goal eventually was not SDE. Start as early as possible. Decide your domain in which you want to go. Practice and learn accordingly. Do DSA. Have good knowledge about everything you’re mentioning in your resume, especially projects.
