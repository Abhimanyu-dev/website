## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
I was more oriented towards getting a core job. Solely I was not preparing for this role.
Those who are going for core, resources are very easily available nothing usually comes out
of your course content. What you have to do is grasp your core concepts properly. Analog and
Digital from ESC201. Sampling questions, practical laboratory-based questions, ESO203,
these were most important things. For core prep last 15-20 days are more than enough.
I was not majorly oriented towards prep of a Data scientist so I can’t really suggest resources
for that, but I feel the machine learning concepts you learn while doing your course or any
project are enough.
For SDE prep I used youTube, Codechef and I was not a very good coder I started and did
coding in 3-month time only. Again, because my goal eventually was not SDE.
Start as early as possible.
Decide your domain in which you want to go.
Practice and learn accordingly.
Do DSA.
Have good knowledge about everything you’re mentioning in your resume, especially projects.
