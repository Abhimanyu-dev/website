Yash Vardhan Raizada, studying in IIT Kanpur as a B.Tech. student in CE will be joining Microsoft India as Software Engineer. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1. Microsoft - SDE
2. JPMC - Analyst

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlisting
2. Test
3. Interviews (2-3 rounds)

The placement process was a unique experience full of excitement, stress and a lot of learning. Before sitting for the placement season, I had already decided to target SDE roles specifically and
keep ML and Analytics roles as a backup.

The standard resume shortlisting and placement tests were quite same for both. J P Morgan Chase also asks Aptitude and Mathematics besides programming in their tests.

Interview Experiences:

Our campus interviews were scheduled on December 1, and both of my interviews were scheduled during the first slot of 8 hours (Day 1, Slot 1).

Microsoft:
Great Experience. It was one of the interviews where I felt like I was actually working with them and not interviewing. Apart from the standard coding rounds, they let you ask questions to them and then they give answers and follow up with you on how you think of the problem etc. Just be very well prepared with the fundamentals and practice communicating technical ideas and processes verbally, it helps a lot.

J P Morgan Chase:
Wonderful experience with very collaborative interviewers. They ask you a combination of programming and mathematics questions. The mathematics round was a bit challenging, but the interviewer helped me think through the problems very clearly until I solved them successfully.

Sample Interview Questions:

Microsoft Interview:
Round 1 (Technical):
Introduction
Q1. Based on a partial reversal of the Linked List.
Q2. BFS Traversal on a Matrix of 0s and 1s.
Resume Project based questions.
Questions on differences between C++ and Python. Why C++ used in Game Development ?
Be very neat in writing code. Keep it modular, use functions, give proper names to the
variables. Also don’t forget to ask questions and clarify the problem and input before solving it.
Round 2 (Technical + Behavioral + HR based):

This interview round was with a senior manager at Microsoft.
The interviewer asked me to ask questions about Microsoft or anything I wanted to know
about Microsoft or its products. It was pretty behavioral and challenging.
I asked her about the team structure and workflow, new products they were working on and
about the Underwater Data Centers they are building (The interviewer was very impressed by
this question. I had earlier watched a video regarding the same !).
Then she asked me a question on Semaphores Design, which after some help I was able to
explain satisfactorily. I had told her during the conversation that I am not from a CS
Background, so she gave me hints whenever I got stuck.
Rest of the interview was about deep-diving on technologies and further questions that
emerged due to our conversation. There was a good amount of verbal technical
communication that happened. Be good at it !
Both the rounds were about 1 hour each.

Result: Offer !

JPMC Interview:
Round 1 (Programming + Technical):
Around 45 minutes interview.
Interviewer asked me to reverse the Linked List and write a code for it.
Detailed questions and explanations of OOPS Concepts with examples.
Differences between C++ and Python.
Probability questions on Expectation and Integral Evaluations.
Asked me to write the code for Dijkstra. Follow up questions on priority queue and heaps were
also asked.

Round 2 (Mathematics):
Hard Probability problems on Expectation and Variance.
Integral Evaluation - Medium
Joint Probability Distribution
Question on Leibnitz Theorem.
Some basic math puzzles.
I solved about 3.5 questions out of 5. But the interviewer was very helpful.
Discussion on life as a quantitative analyst.
For preparation, one can look up at brainstellar.com problems and solve questions from 50
Challenging Problems in Probability.
Round 3 (HR):
Basic HR stuff, discussion of the offer, opportunities, activities etc.

Result: Offer !

##  Preparation Resources
My preparation was mainly through LeetCode, InterviewBit and Brainstellar. I had made up
my mind to target SDE/ML and Quant/Analytics roles.

InterviewBit is a great resource. I went through the tutorials on DS/Algo, articles on ML and
other CS Fundamental topics: OOP, CN, DBMS and OS. Try to practice 2-3 questions from
each basket.

I also learnt SQL and practiced writing queries here. Also one can go through some of the
system design questions as well to get to know more about real world software engineering. It
may help you in some of the advanced technical rounds of some startups.

Besides these, I regularly attempted Weekly and Bi-Weekly contests on LeetCode, apart from
solving mock assessments on LC and practicing mock interviews on IB. Be consistent in your
practice, it will help you a lot !

For puzzles, I practiced questions from the 50 Challenging Problems in Probability,
Brainstellar and InterviewBit puzzles sections. For aptitude, I practiced solving past CAT
papers and enrolled in a placement preparation test series by PrepLeaf.

But 80% of my time was spent practicing more and more DSA questions and studying ML, CS
Fundamental articles on GFG, IB, Medium etc.

Regarding resume, I would suggest everyone to go through the SPO Preparation Folder. Just
keep it precise and crisp, not exceeding 1 page. Make sure you are prepared to defend each
and every point written on it, even from the extracurricular section. Also, do get it reviewed
multiple times by at least 5 seniors, till you get satisfied.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Some very important tips:

Take care of yourself and your health. Keep it a top priority. Indulge in some form of physical
activity or workout which you can do regularly without losing out a lot of energy and disturbing
your schedule and commitments. It will help you to stay motivated, healthy and happy.

Take care of your mental health. Switch off the notification of Social Media apps, if it takes
away your peace of mind. Find a close friend, with whom you can ease out your post
assessment stress and share your experiences. It will help you out a lot !

Take ample rest, but do follow a schedule. Be in touch with your seniors, you can’t imagine
how motivating and helpful their advice can be ! Trust them, they have also gone through
similar experiences.
