Munish Gupta , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT  student in MTH  will be joining Da Vinci Derivatives. as Quantitative Researcher. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Worldquant(Quant Researcher), Quantbox (QuantResearcher and Developer), Squarepoint(Developer), JPMC(Software), Kivi Capital(Quant),Morgan Stanley(Quant) on Day 1.

## Insights on the Selection Process
A representative from HR and from the technical team was present on the virtual call (Zoom).Once they give you a technical question, you are given 30 seconds to a minute to come upwith the solution or your approach. They ask you to think aloud to get to know the thoughtprocess. The Interview also involved standard HR questions, Why quant, why Da Vinci, etc.Another HR question was to describe a project that inspired you the most and the conditionsyou overcame. There was only one round and lasted around 45 mins.

##  Preparation Resources
For Quants - 50 Challenging problems in Probability, Cut the knot: Probability Riddles,brainstellar.com, A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews by Xinfeng Zhou andMSO201 slides.For Coding - leetcode, InterviewBit and CodingNinjas. Try to cover the breadth first.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Placement shortlists do involve a bit of luck, so don’t be disheartened if you are not initiallyshortlisted. Try to do previous year or company-specific questions as they are sometimesrepeated. In hindsight, I’d suggest starting the prep as early as possible. Even if you aretargeting other profiles, try to do a bit of coding. Lastly, a good group while preparing willdefinitely help.
