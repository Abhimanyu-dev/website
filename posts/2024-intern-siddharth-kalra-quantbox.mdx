## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
DO’s- Focusing on CP and codeforces rating will give an edge over others in both interview round and shortlisting round. If you have the confidence to do CP and get good rating, go for CP instead of interviewbit/leecode. Though standard DSA questions/standard DSA algos dekh lena tab bhi interview se pehle. 1600+ is fine for intern. Otherwise, go for interviewbit. Don’t’s- Focusing on development/ML wont help.
