Akshat Gupta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Akshat Gupta 200085 Economics (with Double Major in CSE) Double Major student  will do
 summer internship in JPMC (Data Science) profile at J.P Morgan &Chase. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver (Software) JPMC (Data Science) Morgan Stanley (Quant) Sprinklr (Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
Optiver- 1st round -> Aptitude test; 2nd round -> Coding test (got shortlisted after solving 1 out 3 questions) ; Final round -> Interview (via Zoom) ; only gave the first round of interviews. JPMC- 1st round ->Aptitude + coding test (easy), 2nd round -> Interview (2 technical + 1 HR) MS- 1st round -> Aptitude + Verbal skills + coding test (easy) , 2nd round ->interview (didn’t’ give interview, so can’t give details) Sprinklr- 1st round -> coding test (3 questions, moderate-tough) , 2nd round -> interview (didn’t’ give interview, so can’t give details)

## Insights on the Interview Process
Optiver - They focused more on software fundamentals in the first round like brainstorming ideas for functionalities using methods like UML diagrams (CS253 would help). JPMC - The initial aptitude round had mainly high-school prob and algebra questions. The coding round had two questions ( 1 arrays, 1 DP-based). Interview had 3 rounds. The first round was a technical round with one interviewer. Questions based on probability (from 50CP, Brainstellar) , coding questions (simple questions based on arrays, maps etc., don’t remember all questions). Second round was with two higher-ups, focused more on theoretical understanding of data science, along with some HR-like questions and questions from my resume. HR-round was chill.

## Sample Interview Questions
Optiver- Coding round -> 1 question based on topological sorting; interview -> basically a brainstorming session using UML diagrams JPMC- Interview questions- was asked the difference between correlations and covariance, coding question based on how to find duplicates in an array, prob questions straight from 50CP and Brainstellar. 2nd round -> was asked theoretical questions like reasoning behind selecting different ML models, questions based on precision and recall, some general prob questions based on Bayes rule, etc.

##  Preparation Resources
Leetcode & InterviewBit (for coding practice), GFG & ESO207 (for theory), 50 challenging problems and Brainstellar (for probability and puzzles)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Make the full use of your summers. Writing down a weekly/daily schedule helped in my case. It ensures you actually get stuff done, plus boosts your confidence in your own prep. Prepare a good introduction for yourself, and get help from your seniors for this who have given such interviews. A good intro can set the interviewer in a good mindset, plus it helps you set the narrative for your interview. (Tip -> mention the topics you are confident about briefly in your intro) Stay connected with your friends, can’t stress how important this is. Will help you stay updated, and most importantly stay motivated. Give your best but try not to stress about it too much. Sometimes the decision of a company might seem irrational, but it is important not to take it personally and move forward.
