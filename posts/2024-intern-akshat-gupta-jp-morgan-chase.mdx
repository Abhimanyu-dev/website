## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Make the full use of your summers. Writing down a weekly/daily schedule helped in my case. It ensures you actually get stuff done, plus boosts your confidence in your own prep.
Prepare a good introduction for yourself, and get help from your seniors for this who have given such interviews. A good intro can set the interviewer in a good mindset, plus it helps you set the narrative for your interview. (Tip -> mention the topics you are confident about briefly in your intro)
Stay connected with your friends, can’t stress how important this is. Will help you stay updated, and most importantly stay motivated.
Give your best but try not to stress about it too much. Sometimes the decision of a company might seem irrational, but it is important not to take it personally and move forward.
