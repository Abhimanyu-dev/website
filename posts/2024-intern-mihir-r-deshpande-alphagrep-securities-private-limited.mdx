Complete standard resources (Xinfeng, 50 CP, Brainstellar, PuzzledQuant, InterviewBit, Leetcode hard) before moving on to more niche ones (Heard on the Street, QuantGuide, the book on Dice Games for JaneStreet, fast mental math and other games for Optiver). Make sure to remember all the techniques you use during your prep – be it quant, puzzles or CP – it must strike you quickly during your company tests / interviews. Don’t get demotivated just because some companies rejected you, opportunities are plenty. Do not aim for a specific company early on – first make sure your overall intern prep is good. Learn about how to give good interviews. There are many minute details which distinguish a great interview from an average one. Make sure to give many mock interviews before Day 1. Have a thoughtful question in mind to ask your interviewer at the end.
