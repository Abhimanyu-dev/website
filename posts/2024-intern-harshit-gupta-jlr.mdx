Harshit Gupta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Harshit Gupta
210442
EE- Btech will do
 summer internship in Jaguar Land rover India Limited's software intern profile at JLR. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
De shaw (for interview)
Optiver (for gd)

## Insights on the Selection Process
Initially, there was a resume shortlisting, followed by a combined coding and aptitude test, and
finally, one interview round. The test was relatively manageable, with coding questions of

medium difficulty—around three, if memory serves correctly. I managed to solve two of them.
Before the coding section, there was a timed aptitude segment, where we had to tackle as
many questions as possible. The format involved an interesting twist: Correct answers
increased the difficulty of subsequent questions, while incorrect answers decreased it.

##  Preparation Resources
I focused most of my preparation efforts during the summer. However, I had also completed a
DSA course during the 4th semester and regularly practiced competitive programming, which
helped improve my coding skills. I primarily used InterviewBit for resources and continued
practicing competitive programming in May. Additionally, during this time, I worked on an ML
project under Professor Avinash Sir from May to July and completed a one-month internship
from mid-June to mid-July.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
I suggest identifying your own weaknesses and areas for improvement, rather than following
what everyone else is doing. Only you can gauge your capacity effectively. Lastly, maintain
consistency. Internship season can be stressful for everyone, so give it your best effort.
Remember, it will all be over in 2-3 months.
