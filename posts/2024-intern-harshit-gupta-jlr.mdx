insights.

## Insights on the Selection Process
Initially, there was a resume shortlisting, followed by a combined coding and aptitude test, and finally, one interview round. The test was relatively manageable, with coding questions of medium difficulty—around three, if memory serves correctly. I managed to solve two of them. Before the coding section, there was a timed aptitude segment, where we had to tackle as many questions as possible. The format involved an interesting twist- Correct answers increased the difficulty of subsequent questions, while incorrect answers decreased it.

## Insights on the Interview Process
My interview lasted approximately 45-50 minutes. It consisted of a single round, primarily focusing on my resume. With notable projects and a brief internship at a startup, the interviewers delved deeply into each aspect. They requested detailed explanations of every project, emphasising my machine learning (ML) project. The remaining time was dedicated to discussing my web development project and internship experience. Interestingly, there were no coding questions, and the interview was conducted by two interviewers. All questions were technical in nature, without any behavioural inquiries.

##  Preparation Resources
I focused most of my preparation efforts during the summer. However, I had also completed a DSA course during the 4th semester and regularly practiced competitive programming, which helped improve my coding skills. I primarily used InterviewBit for resources and continued practicing competitive programming in May. Additionally, during this time, I worked on an ML project under Professor Avinash Sir from May to July and completed a one-month internship from mid-June to mid-July.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
I suggest identifying your own weaknesses and areas for improvement, rather than following what everyone else is doing. Only you can gauge your capacity effectively. Lastly, maintain consistency. Internship season can be stressful for everyone, so give it your best effort. Remember, it will all be over in 2-3 months.
