## Insights on the Selection Process
Selection Process for Arthur D Little:
1. Resume shortlisting: Typical consulting resume shortlisting. They look for peaks like
high CPI, Day-1 Internship, Research publications, etc.
2. Buddy Case practice: After the shortlist, a buddy is assigned to help in your case
preparation. Timing is such that you can practice maximum 3-4 cases with your buddy
so one should not rely only on these.
3. Final Interviews (Day1, Slot1):
Round 1 - (Manager Round)
A guesstimate or case interview. Experience varies individually.
Round 2 - (Partner Round)
Can be a case interview or a general HR discussion. Experience varies individually.

Pro tip- Know your resume inside out. You can be grilled on every single word you
mention on the resume.

Insights on Interview Process:

Some special Notes about the Arthur D. Little interview process-
1) The major bottle neck is the Resume shortlisting. Only 15-20 people get shortlisted
from all the people that apply.
2) The Buddy sessions are non-evaluative, so make proper use of them to get a good
flavor of what can be expected in the interviews. Try to talk to the buddies about the
company and what they expect from you. This is the part of the process where you
can understand if the company is really a right fit for you.
3) The final interviews can be radically different from person to person. Some might find
them extremely easy and some might struggle. It depends highly on the interviewer.
Do not assume anything about what they might ask or how you might perform. Just
focus on giving your best.

Sample Interview Questions:

Round-1(Manager round)-
1) Basic HR questions and questions on resume(I can't remember exactly what
questions)

2) Guesstimate-
Estimate the quantity of denim cloth used in Mumbai in one year. (Interviewer was only

interested in the approach. Once I cleared up my approach, the interviewer did not
allow me to put numbers and perform calculations. He simply acknowledged the
approach and closed the interview)

Round-2 (Partner round)-
There were no questions in the interview. It was just a conversation with both of us
sharing our opinion on topics of interest and discussing how they might be relevant to
anyone in their regular lives. In my opinion, the partner wanted to check how well I
would fit in the company and how well can I communicate with clients on project.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1) Start making your master resume from the summers before 7th semester itself. You
can add anything new you do later on. Get the resume looked at by as many seniors
and friends as possible. Do not write anything on the resume that cannot be
confidently defended.
2) Form groups for practicing cases and begin practicing as soon as you can after the 6th
semester. Practicing cases individually is not useful. To get an idea about case
solving, you can practice a few cases with seniors. Utilize the buddy round cases for
understanding the general flavor of cases expected in the interviews.
3) Be confident during the interviews. Since this is a client facing role, you need to have
good communication skills. Keep smiling and do not get frustrated by your
interviewer’s conduct, they might be stress-testing you.
4) Read as much as you can about the company. It helps in asking good questions
during the interviews and assures the company of your interest in the firm.
