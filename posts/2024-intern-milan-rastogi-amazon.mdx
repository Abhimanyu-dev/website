Milan Rastogi, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Name- Milan Rastogi Roll No. - 210610 Branch- Chemical Engineering Programme- B. Tech student  will do
 summer internship in Company Amazon Intern Profiles SDE profile at Amazon. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
I was mainly shortlisted for SDE roles in Oracle and Amazon and for Quant role in Goldman Sachs.

## Insights on the Selection Process
The selection process of Amazon was a test followed by an online interview session. The test was simple and consisted of two coding questions. The interview ran on for about an hour. There was only a technical round. No HR questions were asked. However there was a section of multiple HR questions after the written test.

## Insights on the Interview Process
While giving the interview, I realized that they do not judge you only on your problem solving ability but also on the way you act when you cannot solve any problem. During my interview, I got stuck in a problem, basically I had to reduce the time complexity of the code that I had given. So I tried to work with the interviewer, by explaining to him what I was thinking and then utilizing the hints he gave me to solve the problem.

## Sample Interview Questions
Amazon mainly has an archive of questions. The interview questions are most likely to come from there only. You can refer to leet code or interviewbit for such questions.

##  Preparation Resources
During my prepration I mainly used interviewbit for solving problems. I studied from multiple youtube resources like striver, Aditya Verma and Luv.
