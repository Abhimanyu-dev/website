##  Insights on the interview process
In the coding interview round, I was asked to write the codes on an A4 size sheet. After clearing the coding interview round, I was asked about the projects on my resume and about my internship at Amazon. I was also asked to tell about the Tech stacks which would be required to build Navi’s app to which I replied that I did not know much about software development.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1. Print the Pascals triangle (easy). 2. Was a modification of the Hamming distance problem(hard). Second question involved concepts of DSU (Disjoint Set Union) and I was asked to dive deep into the time complexity of each part of the code and was also asked to improve the code to the best time complexity possible.

## Preparation Resources
1.Participate in contests held in codeforces and studied about algorithms from cp- algorithms and ‘Algorithms Live’ Youtube channel 2.Solved questions from interviewbit (especially Dynamic Programming section). 3.For quant/HFT firms, I had practised puzzles from brainstellar and the book ’50 Challenging Problems’.

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
1. Do not lie about anything in your resume 2. Prepare well for interview so that you can give your introduction briefly and precisely. And similarly prepare well to speak about your work done at your internship and projects.
