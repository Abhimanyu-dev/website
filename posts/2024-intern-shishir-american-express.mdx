 summer internship in American express: Intern -

Technology

(Software roles.) profile at American Express. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
American Express-SDE

## Insights on the Selection Process
I was selected through a series of coding tests followed by shortlisting

and 2 rounds of interviews.

Coding round- There were questions from DSA, and development

problems to be solved in R and JavaScript.

Insights regarding selection- familiarity with coding rounds since I have

been eligible for most of the companies in the round one inter drive.

Practicing problem solving under time constraint and doing projects

where I explored other domains really came to the rescue. Hence coding

round was cleared.

Regarding interview- Round 1- It was basically a technical interview

which started with basic introduction and project & skill discussion

followed by a doable DSA question. Round-2 was hard where tricky

questions were asked and resume was thoroughly discussed.

Insights on interview- Know how to lead an interview. It is not just a

Q&A round where you are supposed to simply answer what is asked.

The skills, knowledge, and even personality is judged. Therefore, you

must know your resume, the strength and weakness and lead the

interview accordingly. Practice mock interviews.

## Advice for students (do’s and don’ts)? 
The resources that I referred to are already mentioned above.

### Do’s:
- Plan your summers.
- Learn with friends and discuss as it helps in getting to know others' approach.
- Be patient and keep on working until your day comes. Keep your mind calm in all situations.
- Focus on also developing cool skills other than these so the journey has fun elements too.

### Don’ts:
- Do not be harsh on yourself as it might affect future days. Consistency is key.
- Do not bother yourself with myths and previous year stats. Focus only on yourself.
- Do not share all your BT with friends and seniors.
