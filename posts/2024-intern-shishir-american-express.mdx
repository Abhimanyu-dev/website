## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
American Express-SDE

## Insights on the Selection Process
I was selected through a series of coding test followed by shortlisting and 2 rounds of interview. Coding round- There were questions from DSA, and development problems to be solved in R and javascript. Insights regarding selection- familiarity with coding rounds since I have been eligible for most the companies in the round one inter drive. Practicing problem solving under time constraint and doing projects where I explored other domains really came in to rescue. Hence coding round was cleared. Regarding interview- Round 1- It was basically a technical interview which started with basic introduction and project &amp; skill discussion followed by a doable DSA question. Round-2 was hard where tricky questions were asked and resume was thoroughly discussed. insights on interview- Know how to lead an interview. It is not just a Q&amp;A round where you are supposed to simply answer what is asked. The skills, knowledge, and even personality is judged. Therefore , you must know your resume , the strength and weakness and lead the interview accordingly. Practice mock interviews.
