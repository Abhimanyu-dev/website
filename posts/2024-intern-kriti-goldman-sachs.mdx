Kriti, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Name- Kriti Roll No. - 210534 Branch- CSE Programme- B.Tech Any other things you will like to tell us about yourself (Optional) I love writing. I write from the heart, and sometimes my pieces turn out a bit lengthy (as you can see below). student  will do
 summer internship in Companies Goldman Sachs Intern Profiles Summer Analyst profile at Goldman Sachs. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Graviton (Quant) Optiver Quant GD Goldman Sachs (SDE) JP Morgan (Quant) JP Morgan (Analytics) Google (SDE) Microsoft (SDE) Microsoft (TPM)

## Insights on the Selection Process
There was 1 coding question which was to be answered on paper. They increase the difficulty as you answer, for the same question. I was interviewed for a software role. Generally, there were 3 rounds (~40 mins). But in my case, I could solve all the variants of one question in about 20 mins. (PS. It was a very very hard problem – DP on graphs). So, had only 1 round and the interviewer been so impressed that he told me that I will be getting the offer during the interview.

## Insights on the Interview Process
Also, they do check your resume and question you if they find some PORs (why were you so involved in extra-curriculars) and also if you don’t have a 9+ CPI, and why GS, why not other firms? but these are just secondary questions. They don’t care much what you answer, but they see your confidence level. These are just secondary things. If you solve the coding questions, that will fetch you the offer. GS does not expect you to code, or check the syntax, also I didn’t even write the whole pseudo code on paper. I explained my approach and my interviewer was happy with that. They just want to check how you approach the problem and your logic. One special thing about GS was they have 2 roles – Quant and Software, but they interview for a role which they feel fits for you, not the case with other companies, and then your interviewer is the one who will be one of your team members (manager/associate) when you join. So, it depends on him if he thinks he needs you in his team, he will roll out an offer. Is it good or bad? – I leave it on you -)

## Sample Interview Questions
GOLDMAN SACHS - A maze of 1s and 0s and you can only travel on 1s • Return if path exists from 0,0 to n,n • Return shortest path • Shortest path if any one 0 can be traveled • Shortest path if any k 0s is allowed MICROSOFT – • Some islands cluster question, again its variant asked later was dp + graphs. • Again 1 round like gs of ~20 mins, type and run your code, and your good to go (got the offer) • How to reduce space complexity for Visited vector was also asked (answer is changing 1s to 0s, don’t keep a vector then) Google – • Round 1 was some greedy algo question. Some jobs scheduling. • Round 2 was graphs, dfs + trees knowledge. • Google is so much about clean code. So good coding practices help, no need to compile, just write a clean code JPMC analytics – • Probs + stats stats stats • Some very basic dp question • A puzzle – x accidents in 1 hr, how much in half hour (very easy one) JPMC Quant – • Was in JP Morgan quant mentorship program • Had coding questions (dsu, or I would say they ask the toughest coding question out of all what you mention on resume) • OOPS (2 rounds entirely on OOPS only) Graviton – • questions were direct from 50 CP. My interviewer was late so when he arrived, he opened screenshots of questions and all were from 50 CP and he asked me a question from heard on the street iirc also, it was there are 2 urns and if 2 red balls were picked from one then blue is added, if both different then nothing .. something like this • But later when I answered this, he asked 2 more questions on this, it was like - Which ball can have 100% probability to remain at last and what should be the relation between balls for 100% probability for a blue ball? • All 4 cases red even, blue odd, .... and so on were to be considered • There was resume discussion for 20 mins. I had a project on data science in JPMC mentorship program. He discussed everything about the project, also the hyperparameter tuning part, and how the output be different if gamma or kernel were this. And also about algos done in cs771 Microsoft TPM – • It was all about resume, general talks • I had a very interesting project (I got the offer quite easily, not to brag). If you'd like to discuss it further, feel free to give me a call.

##  Preparation Resources
Coding- Interview bit (covered almost all the questions), Leetcode Coding resources- gfg, Apna College, some famous youtuber for stacks and binary search (I forgot the name) Quant- Brainstellar, xinfeng zhou, 50 CP, heard on the street (I had a direct question from 50 CP in Graviton Interview) (decide between heard on the street/ xinfeng zhou, rest 2 are mandatory) 80 in 8, and Optiver specific games – for Optiver OOPS- there are some 50 MCQs on Interviewbit, decent enough. If you don’t know the answer, google that, will learn in this process.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
• There are 2 important things, CPI and coding skills. You can’t change your CPI. The only thing in your hand is coding. Don’t waste these 3 crucial months in summer. • Build your resume for at least 3 profiles. Get it verified by many many many seniors. I sent my resumes to > 20 seniors. • Do coding and puzzles, both daily (set your slots). • Give mock interviews. I gave it to some seniors as well as some organizations to help you in this. I had already applied off campus before main intern drive, so had an experience of interview in more than 10 corporates/ startups. This helped me so much that I was not at all nervous in any of my interviews on day 1. • Be confident in your interview. Think loud. Talk about whatever you are thinking. • Take your time, ask time if you want to think on some question. Don’t sit quite and start thinking. If you need time, ask for it, that won’t look bad then. • If you know the answer to a question, don’t say that you have solved the question earlier (obviously). • Ask questions at the end of the interview. Whenever I say this, people think about what to ask. Don’t ask dumb questions. Best is – ask your feedback. They will feel you are brave enough to ask. Interact with the interviewer. Ask about what he does in the company. Or ask what skills you need before joining next year – seems like you are interested in joining the company I think that’s all. If someone reading this wants to contact me, feel free to reach out anytime. I will be more that happy to share more gyaan xD. Good Luck!
