Kriti, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Name Kriti Roll No.  210534 Branch CSE Programme B.Tech Any other things you will like to tell us about yourself (Optional) I love writing. I write from the heart, and sometimes my pieces turn out a bit lengthy (as you can see below). will do
 summer internship in Companies Goldman Sachs Intern Profiles Summer Analyst profile at Goldman Sachs. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Graviton (Quant) Optiver Quant GD Goldman Sachs (SDE) JP Morgan (Quant) JP Morgan (Analytics) Google (SDE) Microsoft (SDE) Microsoft (TPM)

## Insights on the Selection Process
There was 1 coding question which was to be answered on paper. They increase the difficulty as you answer, for the same question. I was interviewed for a software role. Generally, there were 3 rounds (~40 mins). But in my case, I could solve all the variants of one question in about 20 mins. (PS. It was a very very hard problem – DP on graphs). So, had only 1 round and the interviewer been so impressed that he told me that I will be getting the offer during the interview.

##  Preparation Resources
Coding Interview bit (covered almost all the questions), Leetcode Coding resources gfg, Apna College, some famous youtuber for stacks and binary search (I forgot the name) Quant Brainstellar, xinfeng zhou, 50 CP, heard on the street (I had a direct question from 50 CP in Graviton Interview) (decide between heard on the street/ xinfeng zhou, rest 2 are mandatory) 80 in 8, and Optiver specific games – for Optiver OOPS there are some 50 MCQs on Interviewbit, decent enough. If you don’t know the answer, google that, will learn in this process.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
• There are 2 important things, CPI and coding skills. You can’t change your CPI. The only thing in your hand is coding. Don’t waste these 3 crucial months in summer. • Build your resume for at least 3 profiles. Get it verified by many many many seniors. I sent my resumes to > 20 seniors. • Do coding and puzzles, both daily (set your slots). • Give mock interviews. I gave it to some seniors as well as some organizations to help you in this. I had already applied off campus before main intern drive, so had an experience of interview in more than 10 corporates/ startups. This helped me so much that I was not at all nervous in any of my interviews on day 1. • Be confident in your interview. Think loud. Talk about whatever you are thinking. • Take your time, ask time if you want to think on some question. Don’t sit quite and start thinking. If you need time, ask for it, that won’t look bad then. • If you know the answer to a question, don’t say that you have solved the question earlier (obviously). • Ask questions at the end of the interview. Whenever I say this, people think about what to ask. Don’t ask dumb questions. Best is – ask your feedback. They will feel you are brave enough to ask. Interact with the interviewer. Ask about what he does in the company. Or ask what skills you need before joining next year – seems like you are interested in joining the company I think that’s all. If someone reading this wants to contact me, feel free to reach out anytime. I will be more that happy to share more gyaan xD. Good Luck!
