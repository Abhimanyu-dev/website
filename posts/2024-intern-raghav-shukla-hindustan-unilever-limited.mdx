insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
ITC-Supply Chain

## Insights on the Selection Process
There are a total of 3 rounds- Round 1- Resume cum Form round In this round, students are asked to fill out an online form known as the ‘ULIP Application Form’. Based on the resume and the form response, a branch-wise shortlist is made for each profile offered. Round 2- HireVue round HireVue is a hiring platform used to conduct video interviews. Unlike a normal interview, there is no live/actual interviewer on the other side in a HireVue video interview. In the HireVue video interview, there are a total of 3 questions. For each question, the question text is displayed for 2 minutes. In these 2 minutes, the candidate must analyze the question thoroughly and prepare an in-depth answer. After those 2 minutes, the candidate is asked to speak the prepared answer in 3 minutes. The candidate&#39;s answer is video recorded. Each profile (RnD, Supply Chain, Tech) has its own set of 3 questions. Each candidate in a given profile is asked the same set of questions. Based on the performance of the candidates, a profile-wise shortlist is made. Here, no branch considerations are made for a profile. Round 3- Final Interview The final interview is an interview with a senior manager at HUL. The interview may be conducted online or offline. In my case, it was conducted online. There is no HR round.

## Insights on the Interview Process
Round 1- Resume cum Form round a. The shortlisting committee favors candidates with a high CPI and all-round experience acquired through projects, PORs, and other activities. The candidate must try to showcase as many achievements as possible in the resume. b. The form contains multiple questions about the candidate’s achievements (academic and non-academic), aspirations, passions, philosophies, etc. The form plays a major role in this round. The answer to each question is read in detail by the shortlisting committee at HUL. The shortlisting committee at times overlooks the candidate&#39;s CPI if the form is well-written. c. Many times, applicants are overwhelmed by the number and types of questions (a filtering tactic used by the organization). Therefore, one must exercise patience. A smart approach would be to ask seniors for the previous year&#39;s questions and prepare answers beforehand. d. Unilever requires genuine candidates, thus one must ensure that the answers are original. The candidate must refrain from plagiarizing from online websites or any AI chatbot because sometimes the language presented by such sources is unrealistically professional and formal. This may arouse suspicion by the shortlisting committee. (Trust me, people have not been shortlisted because of going down such paths.) e. HUL generally &quot;PREPONES&quot; the form deadline, so one must not wait until the last minute. Round 2- HireVue Round a. The questions in the HireVue Round can be situation-based or purely technical. (Sample questions are given in the sample interview questions section of this article.) b. The applicant must ask previous year candidates about the questions that were asked. c. For Situation-based questions, (specifically for supply chain and tech roles), candidates can go through Unilever’s website, study online about supply chain, challenges in the supply chain, operations, processes, and parameters of launching a new product, HUL’s work in Digital Transformation, and Sustainability. d. For Technical questions, (specifically for supply chain and tech roles), candidates can review their core courses. CHE and ME students can review heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics. EE students can review machines and power systems. e. A strong internet connection should be ensured to avoid hassle. f. The candidate must remain calm throughout and give their best. Round 3- Final Interview The final interview is highly personality-based. This round is characterized by resume grueling, questions from core courses, and HR questions.

## Sample Interview Questions
The following questions were asked from me during SPO internship drive 2023- Sample questions from the form 1. What have you been deeply passionate about, how much time do you spend on it and what has been the outcome? 2. Tell us about one strength of yours that distinguishes you. 3. Any niche skills or advanced knowledge in a subject that would be relevant to the area of internship Sample HireVue Round Questions 1. HUL is planning to launch a global hair care brand which has been a huge success in UK due to its unique and trending formulation. As an Innovation planning manager, partnering the Beauty &amp; Personal care innovations team, you need to decide the supply chain strategy for this innovation. The market size for this product in India is very niche and is less than 10% of the market size in UK. Evaluate all the strategies mentioned below based on their merits and demerits and finalize the strategy best suited for this launch. You can make assumptions for some factors to complete the evaluation a. Manufacture the product at your own facility. b. Outsource the production to a 2P/3P. c. Import the product from UK 2. Explain the working of an induction motor. Explain the relationship between poles and angular speed of an induction motor. 3. What is Reynolds number? Describe its use. Sample Interview Questions- 1.

Why do you want to join HUL? (HR) 5. Technical questions from Power systems. (Technical)

##  Preparation Resources
No resource in particular. I primarily sought guidance from previous year selected candidates. I did take part in ANC GDs. They gave me a feel of how I should participate in a GD.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Just be confident, and extremely thorough with your preparation, especially the CV. Do not lose your nerve if you do not know something in the interview, keep calm and give your best shot!
