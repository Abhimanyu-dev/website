engineering intern profile at Hindustan Unilever limited. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
ITC-Supply Chain

## Insights on the Selection Process
There are a total of 3 rounds:

Round 1: Resume cum Form round

In this round, students are asked to fill out an online form known

as the �ULIP Application Form�. Based on the resume and the form

response, a branch-wise shortlist is made for each profile offered.

Round 2: HireVue round

HireVue is a hiring platform used to conduct video interviews.

Unlike a normal interview, there is no live/actual interviewer on the

other side in a HireVue video interview. In the HireVue video

interview, there are a total of 3 questions. For each question, the

question text is displayed for 2 minutes. In these 2 minutes, the

candidate must analyze the question thoroughly and prepare an

in-depth answer. After those 2 minutes, the candidate is asked to

speak the prepared answer in 3 minutes. The candidate&#39;s answer

is video recorded.

Each profile (RnD, Supply Chain, Tech) has its own set of 3

questions. Each candidate in a given profile is asked the same set

of questions.

Based on the performance of the candidates, a profile-wise

shortlist is made. Here, no branch considerations are made for a

profile.

Round 3: Final Interview

The final interview is an interview with a senior manager at HUL.

The interview may be conducted online or offline. In my case, it

was conducted online.

There is no HR round.

##  Preparation Resources
No resource in particular. I primarily sought guidance from previous year selected

candidates. I did take part in ANC GDs. They gave me a feel of how I should participate in

a GD.

## Advice for students (dos and don�ts)? 
Just be confident, and extremely thorough with your preparation, especially the

CV. Do not lose your nerve if you do not know something in the interview, keep

calm and give your best shot!
