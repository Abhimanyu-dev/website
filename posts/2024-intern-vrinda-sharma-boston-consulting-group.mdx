 summer internship in I will be joining Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as a summer associate. profile at Boston Consulting Group. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Google- SDE Microsoft- Technical Product Manager JP Morgan- Quant Goldman Sachs- Quant

## Insights on the Selection Process
Resume Shortlist- Resume is shortlisted on the basis of 'peaks' in a resume that can testify your excellence in extracurricular activities. CPI is used as a general indicator for academic excellence. However, for several branches with bad grading, make sure you are in the top 1-2 percentile of your branch. Further classification of peaks is as follows- 1. CPI & Academic Scholarships (NTSE, KVPY, Reliance, Other Govt. Scholarships etc.) 2. Research Experience- A good project with any professor (IIT, IIM, IISc etc.). It is even better if such a project is pursued under a summer program like Surge, Spark, etc. 3. Any impactful work done in college is generally reflected through your PoR. 4. Any industry exposure you have had generally reflected through remote internships in the field of your choice. 5. Inter IIT Medals, Social Work, and any other miscellaneous activity that you feel can make you stand out. (On how to choose this miscellaneous activity- think of a key quality it reflects about you and how desirable that quality is, egs- a youtube channel, an art account, a degree in performing arts, etc.)

## Insights on the Interview Process
Immediately after the shortlist, you are allotted a buddy-an alum (can be from any batch, but generally not more than 3-4 years senior). There is a dinner and then almost a week after that, an interview. The interview can have ave 2-3 The first is with a Project Leader and then with Partners or MDPs (Managing Dick Sartner). Initial questions are around the resume. The interview may start with a quesstimate too, This is to warm you up for the 'case' of the interview,

## Sample Interview Questions
Round 1- Q1. Introduce yourself. (I mentioned an upcoming UGP in pure mathematics that wasn't a part of my resume while answering this question) Q2. Do you wish to go into research? (because of the UGP) Q3 Case- An asset management company has approached you. They are seeing losses. What could be the reason? (Because I had a finance and analytics club project) Round 2- Q1. Tell me more about your SURGE Project, (It was concerned with Covid and Maths and hence of consulting interest because of the 'covid' factor).. Q2. Tell me more about your youtube channel. Q3. Case- How does one generate revenue from a youtube channel? How would you increase revenue from yours? What would be the projected revenue if you get x rupees for every 1000 views?

##  Preparation Resources
Victor Cheng videos. Watched 2-3 CIC videos. And did 4-5 cases from IIM-A casebook. (because that's the only way you can practice with your peers, initially) However, my advice would be to jump right into live cases with immediate seniors. That would speed up your learning curve. And then move onto doing cases with more senior batches, Post this exposure you can practice cases with your peers, However, stress upon practicing cases that your peers have done with other seniors rather than following a particular book. The former cases are done much more naturally and hence, prove to be more useful. Make sure you do 2-3 cases with your buddy. They may be done at a gap of 1 week.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1. Stay confident, A confident person can turn even a single shortlist in their favor & an under confident one can ruin any number of chances given to them, 2. Keep with yourself a mentor to help you throughout this journey. During the internship season, peers are also in tough situations and hence you might be at a loss of people to confide in. 3. Keep coding. You mayn't be interested however, if you do it everyday thinking this is a 'backup', you will never be good enough at it. 4. If you undertake internship preparation nicely, you will see a paradigm shift in yourself. Hence, do it to meet the better version of yourself on the other side, and not for any MNC. All the best -)
