## Insights on the Selection Process
The selection process was very long and stressful. There were in all around 7 rounds from resume shortlist and a long personality form to aptitude test to a GD round followed by 2 technical and HR rounds.

## Insights on the Interview Process
My selection was a rollercoaster of emotions for me. I was selected for the GD round but did not get the call back at first and then randomly in the middle of the night I was called out for the technical round. So I think the process is very much unpredictable and students should give their best.

## Sample Interview Questions
In the GD round there is a situation given on random setup and an instantaneous conclusion is to be provided in 10 min. In the technical rounds , most important are core concepts, I was asked about thermo and fluids.Also a lot about my summer research intern under SURGE. For TM- major resource is your core concepts along with brainstellar for some logical reasoning questions. And ofcourse the resume building.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Just be confident and try to narrow your focus on a few profiles, rather than running after a crowd and trying out more things which do not actually have your mind. For TM role specifically, speaking skills are very important so have mock GD rounds before interviews.
