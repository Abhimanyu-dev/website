## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Samsung R&amp;D is the company that selected me, but you might be interested in hearing why I wasn&#39;t selected by other companies that interviewed me before this. My first interview was with Goldman Sachs. It was my first interview ever, so I was extremely nervous, and my preparation wasn&#39;t great—I struggled with coding and, more importantly, with probability and statistics. I want to emphasize that MSO201, which covers probability and statistics, is a crucial part of your preparation. The interviewer spent almost 30 minutes asking me about MSO concepts. So, if you&#39;re aiming for companies like Goldman Sachs, you must be confident in your coding skills, which only comes with thorough preparation, and you should have a solid understanding of MSO topics. This knowledge is also helpful for roles like quant analyst. The next interview was with Adobe, which was purely coding-based. Since I wasn&#39;t well- prepared for coding, I struggled and was rejected. The third interview was for a Qualcomm SDE role. During the interview, they mainly asked me about concepts from ESC201, EE200, and EE250. This was the best interview I ever had, but in the end, they only selected candidates from the CSE for the SDE role, as far as I recall. In conclusion, if you&#39;re confident in your skills, your interviews will likely go well. However, if you&#39;re underprepared, you&#39;ll find it challenging. My advice is to prepare thoroughly and stay calm during interviews. Good luck and prepare well!
