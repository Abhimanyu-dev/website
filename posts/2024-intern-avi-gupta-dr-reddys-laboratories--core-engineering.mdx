## Insights on the Selection Process
There were 3 rounds in total 1. Test Test was online and had 3 sections · Technical Questions Related mostly to Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer in general · Aptitude Questions Typical aptitude problems like identifying the pattern, sequences and puzzles were asked. · HR Questions This question had HR questions like why DRL, why core type questions. 2. Group Discussion A topic related to chemical engineering and a few questions related to it were given. First everyone was asked to speak for 2 minutes turn by turn on a given question of their choosing and later everyone was asked to join in like a typical GD. 3. Interview There were 2 rounds · Technical Round Mostly they ask questions related to some core stuff about reactors, heat transfer or mass transfer. Sometimes they ask you your favourite course and questions from it. · HR Round This was a long round, the interviewer would ask you to go through your resume once and typical HR questions like why DRL, why Core etc. were asked here as well.

##  Preparation Resources
Core Stuff Going through notes of the courses taught in 2 nd year will be suffice. Just make sure that your concepts are clear in these courses. Mental Ability Solving previous year CAT questions can help. In my case going through puzzles section of Interviewbit and solving Brainstellar helped a lot. GD Joining sessions organized by AnC and SPO for GD practice would help a lot. You can also practice GDs with your friends in general, just make sure you have a senior who joins to guide and explain you how to proceed in a GD.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Dos · Try to narrow down the profiles you are targeting as early as possible, narrowing down preparation to 2-3 profiles is better. · Having a diverse profile helps a lot in case of core jobs. · Try to have atleast one project related to domain you are targeting. Don’ts · Try not to rely completely on profiles like Techno-managerial and Consulting as shortlisting in these profiles are highly uncertain. Always have a backup in case you are targeting these profiles. · Don’t write anything on your resume that you are unsure of, make sure that you are thorough with your resume.
