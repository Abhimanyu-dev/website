Aditya Jain, studying in IIT Kanpur as a MT student will be joining Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. in Software Engineering. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1.1 Qualcomm 

1.2 Oracle, SAP, Urban Company 

2.1 VMware, Samsung Bangalore, Amazon, Myntra, Ola 

2.2 Visa, Jio-Saavn, Cisco 

3.2 Fareye

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist
2. GD
3. Written Test - The test comprises of - Aptitude - Logical Reasoning - Quant - Computer Science Fundamentals (OS, CSO, etc). All questions were MCQ.

There are two compulsory rounds of 45 minutes. One round was more on theoretical concepts of computer architecture and the other was on practical implementations (coding) of some hardware modules and some questions to judge the analysis skills.
 
Interview 1 (Theoretical): Only discussed the projects related to computer architecture and created new scenarios in the hardware (like if cache hierarchy is exclusive instead of inclusive what would happen, etc.). To answer the questions, one requires good knowledge of the subject Computer Organization and Architecture (CS622 ACA covers everything). 

Some questions were -
 
• What is prefetcher, how would one identify the optimum lookahead value of prefetcher. 

• Questions on various cache hierarchies. Disadvantages and advantages of inclusive 
cache hierarchy. Design a new cache replacement policy that removes the problem of inclusive victims of inclusion cache hierarchy (There is no solution to the problem without compromising the bandwidth, the interviewer just wants to check your analysis skills. So come up with various approaches and have a discussion on pros and cons.). Cache replacement policies - LRU, Belady. 

• Cache coherence protocols, sparse directory, bus snooping. (Questions related to the project in the resume) 

Interview 2 (Practical): Discussed project. Then asked to share screen and code to implement a cache with LRU cache replacement policy. After the successful implementation using hashmap, the interview asked on the aspects of performance on using link-list, vectors to implement the cache and LRU instead of hashmap. Performance in terms of time and space complexity, temporal and spatial locality of the application in your own laptop's cache, i.e. which will give better performance when the application is executed on your laptop. Answer - Vector will give better performance as it will enjoy spatial locality as all elements of the array are stored contiguous in the memory whereas link list is not necessarily stored contiguous (once some of the nodes are deleted). Link list also consumes more space, so it will also require more memory accesses as compared to vector.
 
Sample Interview Questions:
 
Questions on working of DRAMS - channels, row hit, row miss, banks, case where two subsequent dram requests will take the most time to service. 
I was asked to code for the implementation of the LRU (Least Recently Used) Policy of the cache replacement policy. 


##  Preparation Resources


## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
If you are shortlisted for the interview for this profile and you are not interested, say that in the interview that you want to go for pure SE role and don't want to go in computer architecture. Many students did that and interviewers didn't mind at all and wished them luck for other companies.
