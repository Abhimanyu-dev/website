## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do(s):
- Practice on InterviewBit irrespective of the role you are targeting. For Quant, you can also focus on Brainstellar along with InterviewBit.
- For GD, talk to seniors and instead of speaking mugged up answers in the GD, try to explore and be present. Mugged up answers might leave a negative impression onnthe recruiter.
- Many people do not practice enough DSA questions or do not have a strong sommand on DSA. Practice as much as you can and focus on hard problems. Give enough time for the hard problems, it might take more than one sitting but do not directly jump to see the solution.
- Do GeeksforGeeks’ prop questions.
- Focus not only on DSA, but on OOPs and SQL as well
 
Don't(s);
- Do not waste your summers. Even if you have not started anything, do it in the summers. Utilize your summers to the fullest.
- Do not get disheartened because of your CPI. It is indeed and important factor but not the only factor. If you work hard and give your best, CPI mighy not matter much.
- For people targeting the Consulting profiles, do not just prepare for Consulting. Prepare for other profiles as well.
