## Insights on the Selection Process
Selection process- Direct resume shortlisting (no technical test) followed by an interview. Insights- Highlight core projects, especially TA211/212, if you did well. This goes without saying, but keep your CPI as high as possible (8+ is recommended).

## Insights on the Interview Process
Interview questions I was asked- “Tell me about your key projects.” “According to you, who is more important – the team leader or the team?” “Tell me about yourself.” “Tell me some of your strengths and weaknesses.” “Most of our plants are in remote areas. Are you okay with that?” “What do you like to do in your free time?” “Do you have any questions for us?”

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do’s- Be calm and confident in the interview. Pay attention to the pre-placement talk, ask some questions, and get noticed by the hosts. Use information from the PPT in your interview whenever it is relevant. Have a look at the company’s website, and frame your answers in the interviews accordingly; including points from the PPT and website will give you an advantage. Don’t’s- Ramble on and on and digress. Hesitate to take a minute before answering if you feel the need to think a little.
