Ajmera Sanjay Kumar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Ajmera Sanjay Kumar 210080 CSE – B tech student  will do
 summer internship in Samsung Research Institute@noida &#39;s Intern -R&amp;D profile at Samsung Noida. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Adobe uestions like In adobe - difference between http and https Like basically networks ka basic questions And One coding question was asked on dynamic programming( Print Longest common subsequence ). They didn&#39;t ask me on resume. But for others they asked to explain their resume and two coding questions.

## Insights on the Selection Process
Resume Shortlisted and Generally, Samsung doesn’t take the tests, they only take CSE and EE sometimes, and CPI may be 7+, as I remember.

## Insights on the Interview Process
They came for research and development. Two rounds were there - one normal round and one HR. My Normal round went on for 55 in almost. In normal round, my resume was about 25 mins, then 30 mins for coding . They won&#39;t see what your background They just see How do u answer their questions?

## Sample Interview Questions
It was a easy one minimum difference between maximum and minimum number in all possible M sized subsets in an array of size N They asked why did you do project! What was the need! Why did u do? They also asked why Samsung. what made you choose Samsung?

##  Preparation Resources
I did CP Only Codeforces Codechef Leetcode Atcoder (*These are resources Mostly dependent on all But Initially leetcode to gain confidence Then codeforces atcoder) Then giving contests after sufficient confidence *YouTube I don&#39;t prefer but Read on your own by getting slides from CSE friends of DSA course.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
So basically I only suggest Have patience don&#39;t run behind results Just keep working It&#39;s a long run process So keep yourself motivated speak to u r friends frequently about what they are doing. Keep doing daily. Start now It&#39;s perfect time to start. Approx three months So just keep Focused on very few things Don&#39;t keep multiple goals in short period. Give your 100 percent.
