Ajmera Sanjay Kumar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Ajmera Sanjay Kumar
210080
CSE – B tech will do
 summer internship in Samsung Research Institute@noida &#39;s Intern -R&amp;D profile at Samsung Noida. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Adobe
uestions like
In adobe :
difference between http and https
Like basically networks ka basic questions And One coding question was asked on dynamic
programming( Print Longest common subsequence ). They didn&#39;t ask me on resume. But for
others they asked to explain their resume and two coding questions.

## Insights on the Selection Process
Resume Shortlisted and Generally, Samsung doesn’t take the tests, they only take CSE and
EE sometimes, and CPI may be 7+, as I remember.

##  Preparation Resources
I did CP Only
Codeforces
Codechef
Leetcode
Atcoder
(*These are resources
Mostly dependent on all
But
Initially leetcode to gain confidence
Then codeforces atcoder)
Then giving contests after sufficient confidence

*YouTube I don&#39;t prefer but
Read on your own by getting slides from CSE friends of DSA course.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
So basically
I only suggest
Have patience don&#39;t run behind results
Just keep working
It&#39;s a long run process
So keep yourself motivated speak to u r friends frequently about what they are doing.
Keep doing daily.
Start now
It&#39;s perfect time to start.
Approx three months
So just keep Focused on very few things
Don&#39;t keep multiple goals in short period.
Give your 100 percent.
