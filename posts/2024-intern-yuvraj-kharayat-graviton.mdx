Yuvraj Kharayat, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Yuvraj Kharayat
211208
CSE
B. Tech will do
 summer internship in Graviton (Software) profile at Graviton. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Rubrik (Software)
3) Optiver (Quant)
4) Quantbox (Software)
5) Microsoft (Software)
6) Uber (Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
The selection process first involved an online test which had 3
questions on common DSA topics such as dynamic programming,
graphs etc. Duration of the test was about 1 and a half hours. The rating
of the problems can be assumed to be around 1400-1600 (codeforces).
Then 3 students were shortlisted based on the test, resume played little
role.

##  Preparation Resources
I mostly did Codeforces or Atcoder problem set during my preparation for the software role.
Both resources have a wide variety of educational problems.
For the quant role, I did puzzles on puzzled quant and brainstellar.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Try to solve the problems in a timed environment as well.
- Look for the solution only when you have given enough thought to the problem, and
you have no new ideas to work on.
