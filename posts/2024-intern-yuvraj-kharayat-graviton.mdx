Yuvraj Kharayat, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Yuvraj Kharayat 211208 CSE B. Tech student  will do
 summer internship in Graviton (Software) profile at Graviton. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Rubrik (Software) 3) Optiver (Quant) 4) Quantbox (Software) 5) Microsoft (Software) 6) Uber (Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
The selection process first involved an online test which had 3 questions on common DSA topics such as dynamic programming, graphs etc. Duration of the test was about 1 and a half hours. The rating of the problems can be assumed to be around 1400-1600 (codeforces). Then 3 students were shortlisted based on the test, resume played little role.

## Insights on the Interview Process
The next step in the process was an interview. The duration was around 30-45 minutes. I was asked 3 problems, 2 of them related to dynamic programming and the third one was a slight variation of Dijkstra’s algorithm. The difficulty of the problems was around 1600-1800 (codeforces).

## Sample Interview Questions
nan

##  Preparation Resources
I mostly did Codeforces or Atcoder problem set during my preparation for the software role. Both resources have a wide variety of educational problems. For the quant role, I did puzzles on puzzled quant and brainstellar.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Try to solve the problems in a timed environment as well. - Look for the solution only when you have given enough thought to the problem, and you have no new ideas to work on.
