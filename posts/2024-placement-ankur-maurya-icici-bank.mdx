## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Be strong with the basics Now that I am a working professional now, I know exactly what companies look for in a fresher. Believe me, the only thing you gonna be evaluated on is how much dedicated you were to learn in your college days. Based on the department you belong to, any interviewer would ask you basics from subjects you had in your graduation to assess whether you were genuinely interested in the knowledge your field of study provided you or not. Be confident Interviewers completely understand the anxious state of your mind as you would be appearing for first interviews of your life. Most of the interviewers are mature enough to let you settle down by simply talking about anything you like before they get into the real stuff. But, some interviewers do expect you to be confident on your own. One strategy I used to follow was acting to be confident. When you act like you are confident, it eventually makes you confident in real. Be honest while making your resume Many freshers commit mistake of adding all the fancy points in their resume to impress the interviewer. Believe me, this might backfire on you. An interviewer uses that piece of paper to find out in what domain he can ask you questions. If you add any bluff, there are high chances you would be caught and therefore reducing your chances to get placed. So, make sure you add only what you are confident about in your resume. Think before you answer It wouldn't matter if you take sometime to think before you answer. But if you blabber unclear answer without thinking how to put it forward and explain it clearly, it's surely gonna create a wrong impression even if you knew the answer. Frame the sentence well in your mind and then deliver your answer in a crisp way. Taking those extra 5 seconds to frame a sentence will help you a lot. Prepare well for apti Most of the companies ask for apti in the first round. Make sure you regularly find time to practice those, in order to have an edge over other candidates for clearing the apti. Don't take 'areas of interest' in your resume lightly Many candidates lose their chance because of this. Make sure you add the topics you are most strong in and are genuinely interested in, under the areas of interest. It doesn't always have to be some trending technologies or research topic. Anything that you think you can have a higher level discussion with interviewer on can be added as your areas of interest. An interviewer expects you to have fairly good knowledge about the topics you add in your areas of interest, as those are the topics the interviewer assumes you are genuinely interested in and would have done some decent research on. For example, in my case, I loved competitive coding. So I added simple topics like competitive coding, data structures and design and analysis of algorithm as my areas of interest and never had a problem discussing those topics with interviewers. Don't lose hope even if you get rejected multiple times Last but not the least, no matter what, don't stop yourself from preparing for interviews even after you get rejected multiple times. You can whine or cry over it, but don't stop trying. Keep asking yourself what went wrong the last time and improve yourself on that. Just never give up. I hope these points will be helpful.
