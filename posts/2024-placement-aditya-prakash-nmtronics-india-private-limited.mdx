I am Aditya Prakash (19807065), a BT-MT student of Aerospace Engineering at IITK. I am a student researcher in Space Dynamics and Flight Control Laboratory, where I gained interest and experience in Space Robotics and Control. In addition, I have interned at HCI Lab, University of New Brunswick through MITACS and the Space robotics lab, Tohoku University through Honda YES’ Scholarship. I will be starting my PhD at Georgia Tech in the fall this year., studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Nmtronics, Robotics Engineer. Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
N.A.

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
1. Resume Shortlist 2. Interview

##  Insights on the interview process
In my opinion, this was the most unexpected and credible interview I gave during my placement process. All previous companies would ask some boring questions related to the topic like what this is, what is that without any relevance. However, in this interview, the interviewer, Mr. Sumanyu asked me which project I liked from my resume. And he just started asking questions that led to the very basics which was, tbh, the very correct way to do an interview.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1. What is your fav project in your resume? 2. What would happen if the bot was designed for the Moon rather than on Earth (related to my project)? 3. Explaining the kinematics of the bot I worked on. 4. A little bit into control stuff, but the very basics, nothing advanced.

## Preparation Resources
I wasn’t really expecting any robotics company this placement year. I got lucky that we had an opening on day 6 or 7, I guess. So, I didn’t prepare anything for the robotics profile. In general, have basics covered 1. Kinematics (understanding Degrees of freedom, workspace, joint and task space) 2. Path planning (in robotics) 3. Coding in C++ ( a few robotics companies that interviewed my friends asked questions)

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Robotics, unlike coding profiles, has very to the basic placement process. The questions asked don’t require you to be very expert in the field but expect you to know the basics. So, have your basics revised, know how stuffs work and you are good to go.
