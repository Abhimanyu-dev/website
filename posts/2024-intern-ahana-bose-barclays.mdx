## Sample Interview Questions
Technical interview- The interviewer asked me about my project topics. They stressed upon each and every details. Questions are on Machine learning basically. They asked me about the models in great details. Next were 2-3 coding Questions on python and SQL. 2 puzzle type Questions, some probability and basic statistics based Questions. HR interview- In this part also they hugely focused on the projects. I did 3 projects they asked me which I&#39;m most comfortable with. Then they gave some real life situations/ problems which occurs in workplace and asked me how will I react. Mostly these type of questions were asked in this final round

##  Preparation Resources
I mainly used various youtube channels to study Machine learning. Same with python. For sql I checked W3 schools&#39; site. For puzzles and apti problems I practiced sums from IndiaBix, geeksforgeeks. And Statistics textbooks for basic stat knowledge

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Communication skills should be strong, high vocabulary isn&#39;t needed but what we want to say should be clear to the interviewer. Thorough knowledge about the project topics is needed. In short whatever is there in the cv should be learnt whole heartedly and genuinely. It&#39;s okay to say i don&#39;t know to some questions which we really don&#39;t know. Good Knowledge about machine learning and good coding skills are always plus points.
