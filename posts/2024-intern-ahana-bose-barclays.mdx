Communication skills should be strong, high vocabulary isn&#39;t needed but what we want to say
should be clear to the interviewer.
Thorough knowledge about the project topics is needed. In short whatever is there in the cv
should be learnt whole heartedly and genuinely.
It&#39;s okay to say i don&#39;t know to some questions which we really don&#39;t know.
Good Knowledge about machine learning and good coding skills are always plus points.
