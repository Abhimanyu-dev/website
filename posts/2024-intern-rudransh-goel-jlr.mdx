## Insights on the Selection Process
The test had three parts: SDE, electrical core, and general aptitude. Each part had questions
that were easy, medium, or hard. The SDE questions were not too tough.
My trick was to skip hard questions to make the next ones easier( if you have solved easy,
then next will be of moderate level, and if you have solved moderate, then next will be hard).
This helped me score well on the exam.
