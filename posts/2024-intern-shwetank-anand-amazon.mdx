Shwetank Anand, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Name Shwetank Anand Roll No.  211025 Branch Mechanical Engineering Programme B. Tech will do
 summer internship in Companies Amazon Intern Profiles Software Development Engineer profile at Amazon. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Core Nestle, ITC (FMCG), Software Roles DE Shaw, Finmechanics, American Express, Codenation(Trilogy Innovations), Amazon Data Science Barclays

## Insights on the Selection Process
From SDE point of view, there was only one coding round when it comes to Amazon where two standard DSA questions (min heap and mathematical manipulation) were asked. It ranged from code writing with explanation, optimization and briefing of the solutions in detail. The most important thing is that standard questions and implementation must be on tips especially for topics like trees, graphs, data structures like maps, heaps, queues and stacks. What is quintessential is to ace the interview questions they ask and put in best efforts to solve it diligently. One must be decent in C++ and with the STL implementation.

##  Preparation Resources
Some of the resources that you used during your preparation? SDE P-club Archives are the most important one as it gives you an actual idea about how the questions are going to be. Any standard SDE sheet that covers all the topics and basic questions like Striver’s. Practice thoroughly either on the interviewbit ladder or Leetcode (p.s. try doing 2 easy 3 medium 1 hard from all the topics). After this, one can refer to CSES problemset for completion and revision. Contests on standard platforms like CF, CC, Atcoder maybe helpful and is completely optional. Might help in time and accuracy. Core/FMCG Be thorough with the courses that you have done. Especially for ME, CHE, AE, topics like Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Elementary Solid Mechanics might be a good point to start over. GDs form a chunk of the selection process. Take advise from seniors and form a group targeting for the role to have mock GD sessions under senior’s guidance. Case studies of Group Discussions maybe found on the internet. (e.g. Should a particular worker be fired or not among a diverse group of workers?) Try reading through several such articles and practice few GDs in person to familiarize yourself. Miscellaneous To broaden the spectrum, it is recommended to go through an adequate number of puzzles on sites like GFG, brainstellar and puzzledquant. It comes to help in interview rounds of analyst roles, quant-based firms and several others as well. If time permits, it mightbe a good idea to skim over MSO201 (Probability and Statistics) notes, some acquaintance with concepts like OOPS, DBMS, OS (might refer small playlists available on youtube) that mightbe helpful in subsequent interviews.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do not compare yourself with others. Keep working hard along the line whatever you have decided. Try to be collaborative and keep a learning attitude with your peers. 2. Do not try to do a lot many things simultaneously. Segregate few specific roles and work in that direction. Reach out to seniors who are in those roles and communicate. 3. Be confident in your interviews. No interviewer expects you to be perfect. Making mistakes or not knowing something in the interview is absolutely okay, you just need to keep your calm through the rest of it. 4. Be prepared completely about each and every word that is mentioned in your resume. Failure to comply comes out as a negative impression and avoid any such thing. 5. Keep yourself composed mentally throughout the entire process. It is like a journey where be for the people, take help from parents, friends and everyone. Try to work sincerely five to six hours on a daily basis and substantial changes would be evident.
