Besides this, some other important courses like Machine Learning, Deep learning, and Relevant projects in my resume were also prepared from Utube and coursera. 2) For the core just focus on the profile you are applying for and their related subjects. 3) Also prepared aptitude and statistics which is very essential for the ML/analyst profiles.
