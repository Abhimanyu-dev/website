## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Make a draft resume beforehand and ask seniors for corrections or there would be a lot of load at the end. Do not just aim for 1 or many profiles, choose a few and contact seniors on how to go about the preparation. Some companies have GDs, so prepare for them by forming a group of friends and discussing over a decided topic for some standard duration. In interviews especially software start by saying out what you have understood of the problem, and what are your first thoughts about the solution, and then build upon it. It reflects your problem solving skill from the very basics.
