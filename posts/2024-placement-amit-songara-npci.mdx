My name is Amit Songara, B-tech in Electrical Engineering, roll number - 200112 Skills and interests – Competitive coding, Machine learning, data science, data analytics, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Company – National Payments Corporation of India Profile – IT Analyst. Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Company – Navi Profile – Business Analyst

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
Process was as follows – 1. Online assessment – included MCQs based on aptitude and machine learning/data science basics like decision tree algorithm, SVM etc. The assessment also included coding test which included problems based on dynamic programming and arrays/strings 2. Resume shortlist – resume was shortlisted based on my projects related to data science / data analysis 3. There was no group discussion, only interview was held

##  Insights on the interview process
1.There was only one interview – HR + technical 2.HR discussed about my academic background and company locations and stuff 3.Technical part was based on the projects I had put on my resume 4.Interview was short about 20-25 minutes in online mode

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1. How does decision tree work 2. Explain SVM and comment on linear and non-linear SVM and how it works 3. What models would you train to classify binary and multi variable data 4. You are supposed to predict the prices of real estate, what features would you include in your dataset on which the model is to be trained 5. Write a recursive / dynamic programming algorithm of your choice in any language you prefer (through screen sharing)

## Preparation Resources
1.I read my Data-Mining (IME672) course slides and a similar book before the interview 2.Prepared my coding part by practicing problems on leetcode 3.Learnt the algorithms etc from Geeksforgeeks 4.For overall placement preparation – had done a lot of projects and a lot of coding

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
1.Practice coding by solving Leetcode problems (master medium level problems) 2.For data science / data-analysis based resume – prepare the basics well by reading committed books, learn different algorithms, do many projects, opt for data-mining course 3.Instead of gaining little knowledge of many profiles (which is what many students do just for the sake of placements), I would advice to target and master specific profiles of your interest
