## Sample Interview Questions? 
Technical Test Questions Round 1 Objective Questions (Mostly based on coding, CN, DBMS, OOPs, OS, and system design) A question on banker’s algorithm Round 2 Coding Questions Question 1 https//www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimize-cash-flow-among-given-set-friends-borrowed-money/ Question 2 Prerequisite Travelling Salesman problem and Dijkstra Notice that k is very small, and as can’t greedily get the order in which we should visit the delivery location, we will use bitmask for that. Run Dijkstra for all the k nodes and for the source node (“0”) and store them in some map. Then its standard TSP, Terminating Condition When all bits of bitmask are set, We will return the minimum distance between node and source Node (“0”) Code https//ideone.com/LoEIFP
