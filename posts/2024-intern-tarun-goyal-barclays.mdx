insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
McKinsey
Millenium 

## Insights on the Selection Process
The selection process is pretty simple if you look at it. The main tasks are getting shortlisted for the interview and then cracking it. Those two were the main problems where I faced many questions as to what will happen and what won't.
I was not shortlisted at the start for many companies. I was shortlisted for McKinsey and waitlisted for Millenium. I gave my interview at millenium and was able to crack all the rounds. The HR round however didn't go that well and they had to go with the other candidate. After that I gave interviews at databricks, finmechanics and Barclays. I got my free at Barclays after a long 6 hours of interview process.

##  Preparation Resources
