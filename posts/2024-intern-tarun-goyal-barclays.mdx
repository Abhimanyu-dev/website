insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
McKinsey Millenium

## Insights on the Selection Process
The selection process is pretty simple if you look at it. The main tasks are getting shortlisted for the interview and then cracking it. Those two were the main problems where I faced many questions as to what will happen and what won't. I was not shortlisted at the start for many companies. I was shortlisted for McKinsey and waitlisted for Millenium. I gave my interview at millenium and was able to crack all the rounds. The HR round however didn't go that well and they had to go with the other candidate. After that I gave interviews at databricks, finmechanics and Barclays. I got my free at Barclays after a long 6 hours of interview process.

## Insights on the Interview Process

## Sample Interview Questions
It consisted of 4 rounds including HR one. The first round tested my mathematics which was easy. It was on basic linear algebra and probability with some puzzles. The second round was about the resume and general interests. They grilled me on my Projects and asked me some questions on DSA as well. They also asked some ML questions. Third round was about my dreams and interests and a little DSA. (I think it was the first two rounds that mattered the most) The fourth one was the HR round where they were trying to make me nervous and checking my diplomacy. They asked just a single question about the company and the rest about myself.
