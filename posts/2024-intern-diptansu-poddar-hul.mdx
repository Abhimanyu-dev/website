## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:

## Insights on the Selection Process
The first step of the application was a simple resume shortlisting. We could apply for either an RnD position or "Tech." Tech would land you in either R&D or supply chain, but the outcome would be determined by the final interview if chosen. You will also fill out an application form where they ask about your hobbies and passions. HUL puts great emphasis on CPI while shortlisting resumes. Cutoffs vary across branches and roles. For Chemical Engineers, Tech's cutoff was more than RnD's. HireVue Interview- This is the second round. You must answer three questions and you get 2 minutes for each on the HireVue platform. The answers are automatically recorded and uploaded. The questions primarily involve strategy and supply chain problems; you cannot prepare much for them. You must use your intuition and presence of mind while justifying your answer.

## Insights on the Interview Process
Six candidates competed for the R&D position in the final round. The interviewer has a big impact on how this round goes. If I remember correctly, the interviewer in our instance holds a PhD from the University of Maryland and was an alum of IITK. He told me straightaway that he would not review my resume or ask HR-related questions. After a brief introduction, we jumped straight to technical questions.

## Sample Interview Questions
Questions were tricky and encompassed JEE physics, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics. You must prepare very well for this round. Be thorough with fluids and thermodynamics, mostly ESO201 and a small amount of CHE221/ESO204. Revise the basics such as continuity equation, thermodynamic enthalpies, their significance, etc. He asked me six questions. With a few exceptions that I could only partially explain, the interview proceeded smoothly. The interviewer was kind and would offer me pointers to help me along.

##  Preparation Resources
Yunus Cengel for Thermodynamics, F.M White and Fox and McDonald's for Fluids and lecture notes. Be thorough with your core courses whatever department you are in.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
It is always a good idea to keep your preparation broad. Do not neglect what you've written in your resume, your core courses, and any information about company/role. When faced with a technical question, try to estimate the answer; if you are at a loss for ideas, just say so and move on to the next one.
