## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:

## Insights on the Selection Process
The first step of the application was a simple resume shortlisting. We could apply for either an RnD position or "Tech." Tech would land you in either R&D or supply chain, but the outcome would be determined by the final interview if chosen. You will also fill out an application form where they ask about your hobbies and passions. HUL puts great emphasis on CPI while shortlisting resumes. Cutoffs vary across branches and roles. For Chemical Engineers, Tech's cutoff was more than RnD's.

HireVue Interview: This is the second round. You must answer three questions and you get 2 minutes for each on the HireVue platform. The answers are automatically recorded and uploaded. The questions primarily involve strategy and supply chain problems; you cannot prepare much for them. You must use your intuition and presence of mind while justifying your answer.


##  Preparation Resources
Yunus Cengel for Thermodynamics, F.M White and Fox and McDonald's for Fluids and lecture notes.
Be thorough with your core courses whatever department you are in.


## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
It is always a good idea to keep your preparation broad. Do not neglect what you've written in your resume, your core courses, and any information about company/role.

When faced with a technical question, try to estimate the answer; if you are at a loss for ideas, just say so and move on to the next one.
