Vishal Himmatsinghka, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Vishal Himmatsinghka (211175), B.Tech student in Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur. My domain of interest includes Software (SDE), Quant and Finance. will do
 summer internship in Software Development Intern at Atlassian profile at Atlassian. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Quantitative Researcher at Edelweiss SDE Intern at Oracle

## Insights on the Selection Process
Atlassian is a software based company and was open for Circuital (CSE, EE, MTH, SDS) only. There was no mentioned CPI criteria but the final shortlisted candidates had >7. The process include an Online Assessment with DSA questions mostly on Graphs and Dynamic programming followed by a technical interview again with DSA questions and finally an HR interview.

##  Preparation Resources
For DSA, I used following resources 1. Interview Bit (Complete) 2. Leet Code (Medium problems and Mock Tests) 3. Striver’s playlist (For Graphs mostly) 4. P-Club Archives, CSES and A2OJ ladder (Some parts of them) For Prob and Stats (Quite overallping) 1. PuzzledQuant 2. Xinfeng Zhou (Book) 3. Brain Steller 4. MSO/HSO (Mostly pre-midsem)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do’s 1. Be very well prepared of your resume, like don’t focus on putting many things, just get a very clear idea of whatever you are putting in and prefer to submit the profile relevant one. 2. Be confident in the interviews, that is the key and try to keep it interactive. Don’ts 1. Don’t start too much resources at the same time, you will mess up. I preferred to use any one from each bucket mentioned above at a time. 2. Don’t be confused between the profiles you are applying, and make sure to have some backups as well. The simple formula I will advice is to be persistent and think less, you will succeed.
