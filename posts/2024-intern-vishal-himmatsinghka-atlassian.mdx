Vishal Himmatsinghka, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Vishal Himmatsinghka (211175), B.Tech student in Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur. My domain of interest includes Software (SDE), Quant and Finance. student  will do
 summer internship in Software Development Intern at Atlassian profile at Atlassian. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Quantitative Researcher at Edelweiss SDE Intern at Oracle

## Insights on the Selection Process
Atlassian is a software based company and was open for Circuital (CSE, EE, MTH, SDS) only. There was no mentioned CPI criteria but the final shortlisted candidates had >7. The process include an Online Assessment with DSA questions mostly on Graphs and Dynamic programming followed by a technical interview again with DSA questions and finally an HR interview.

## Insights on the Interview Process
The interview process at Atlassian includes 2 rounds (Both being online), technical and HR. In the technical round I was given a code template of my preferred programming language by the interviewer which consisted of 3-4 incompleted functions inside the class. The round was very interactive and lasted for around 1.5 Hrs. The interviewer was throughout discussing what approach I am using and if there could be any better one and I had to screen share and code in front of him. After this there’s comes the HR round which was also quite extensive around 1 hour where the resume was thoroughly discussed through projects and a keen emphasis was given to the values and team efforts put in projects and the PORs. Interviewer himself asked to discuss one best and kind off worst project from the resume and to share the experiences about them. It is also important to know about the company as they asked few things like why this company, why this role etc. The process was quite different at Edelweiss where the 1st round after OA i.e. a technical round lasted for half an hour in which a lot of python and project related questions were asked. They really focus on the mathematical and statistical aspects of the projects you have done. In the HR as well they were keen to know what out of the box you can think of.

## Sample Interview Questions
At Atlassian, the question asked was from the topic of Graph algorithms around the DSU. The concepts to be known were DFS, Union by size, Union by rank, should be familiar with OOPs techniques as it was around that only. The other question was related to Linked list, something similar to the ‘LRU Cache’ problem. At Edelweiss, some function like Maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, Time frame alternation of a given time series (OHLCV) data etc. were along with some theoretical questions like what is PEP8 in python, covariance matrix etc.

##  Preparation Resources
For DSA, I used following resources- 1. Interview Bit (Complete) 2. Leet Code (Medium problems and Mock Tests) 3. Striver’s playlist (For Graphs mostly) 4. P-Club Archives, CSES and A2OJ ladder (Some parts of them) For Prob and Stats (Quite overallping)- 1. PuzzledQuant 2. Xinfeng Zhou (Book) 3. Brain Steller 4. MSO/HSO (Mostly pre-midsem)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do’s- 1. Be very well prepared of your resume, like don’t focus on putting many things, just get a very clear idea of whatever you are putting in and prefer to submit the profile relevant one. 2. Be confident in the interviews, that is the key and try to keep it interactive. Don’ts- 1. Don’t start too much resources at the same time, you will mess up. I preferred to use any one from each bucket mentioned above at a time. 2. Don’t be confused between the profiles you are applying, and make sure to have some backups as well. The simple formula I will advice is to be persistent and think less, you will succeed.
