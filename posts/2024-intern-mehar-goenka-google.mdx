Mehar Goenka, studying in IIT Kanpur as a  student in Name Mehar Goenka Roll No.  210605 Branch EE Programme B.Tech will do
 summer internship in Google(SDE) profile at Google. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Google – SDE Uber – SDE JPMC – Analyst BCG – Consult

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. BCG selection process was based on the resumes submitted. The Interview consisted of case based questions. 2. JPMC shortlisting was based on the online test. The interview questions were reasoning and maths based. 3. My Uber shortlist was through Uber She++. Google shortlisted on the basis of branch (CSE,EE,MTH,SDS). Both Uber and Google asked DSA questions in the interviews.

##  Preparation Resources
Interviewbit, IITM case book, Brainstellar, MSO201 notes and CS771 refresher for prob stats.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Figure out which roles you have an interest in, rather than preparing for all the roles. If you are targetting SDE, try to cover topics like graphs, trees and dp as soon as possible. Majority of the questions in tests and interviews are from these topics. The tests are much more difficult than leetcode/interviewbit so be prepared. The most important thing is to stay calm during interviews. Think out loud, be polite, listen to the interviewer’s hints and advice while solving the questions.
