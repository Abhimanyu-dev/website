Mehar Goenka, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Name- Mehar Goenka Roll No. - 210605 Branch- EE Programme- B.Tech student  will do
 summer internship in Google(SDE) profile at Google. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Google – SDE Uber – SDE JPMC – Analyst BCG – Consult

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. BCG selection process was based on the resumes submitted. The Interview consisted of case based questions. 2. JPMC shortlisting was based on the online test. The interview questions were reasoning and maths based. 3. My Uber shortlist was through Uber She++. Google shortlisted on the basis of branch (CSE,EE,MTH,SDS). Both Uber and Google asked DSA questions in the interviews.

## Insights on the Interview Process
1. For Consulting, only start doing case prep after you get a shortlist, there will be enough time. The cases asked in the actual interview will be very different from the ones you see during preparation. It is all about structuring your thoughts and asking relevent questions so that the interviewer understands your thought process. 2. For JPMC, brainstellar might be of help. In my interview, the interviewer was making up reasoning and analytical problems based on my projects. 3. For Google and Uber, they give slightly changed versions of questions from interviewbit. They basically test how well you understand the questions, whether you can think of possible solutions, write the code and if you can change the solution to accomodate any other features they tell you later.

## Sample Interview Questions
1. BCG – IITM case book and cases provided by seniors and BCG mentors themselves. 2. JPMC – Brainstellar. Resume questions were about neural networks and eigenvalues, Math question – “Given a random number generator that generates a value between 0 & 1, how will you find the value of pi?”, and other simpler reasoning problems. 3. Google & Uber – Questions were based on graph and tree traversal and were similar to interviewbit questions. Some of the test questions were above InterviewBit/LeetCode level.

##  Preparation Resources
Interviewbit, IITM case book, Brainstellar, MSO201 notes and CS771 refresher for prob stats.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Figure out which roles you have an interest in, rather than preparing for all the roles. If you are targetting SDE, try to cover topics like graphs, trees and dp as soon as possible. Majority of the questions in tests and interviews are from these topics. The tests are much more difficult than leetcode/interviewbit so be prepared. The most important thing is to stay calm during interviews. Think out loud, be polite, listen to the interviewer’s hints and advice while solving the questions.
