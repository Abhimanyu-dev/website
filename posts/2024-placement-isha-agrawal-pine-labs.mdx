Isha Agrawal 200452 BTech Materials Science and Engineering, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Pine Labs Pvt. Ltd Associate Product Manager. Here are some brief insights. 

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:

## Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
1) Aptitude and Technical Test – as there were 2 roles SDE & APM 2) Resume Shortlisting for APM role 3)3 rounds of Interview - Product Thinking - Resume Grilling - HR round

##  Insights on the interview process
1.1st Round was resume-based plus a Product Knowledge-based round. Not given any specific product case but the interviewer analyzed product thinking ability by asking questions related to Resume projects, like “What was the user flow for this app you developed?” Explain the metrics in each step and what was the north star metric.” 2.2nd Round was Resume Grilling- 3.3rd Round was purely HR & behavioral questions.

## Sample Interview Questions? 
1.Explain “Product” in layman's terms. 2.Why Product? 3. Why Pine Labs? 4.What was the north star metric that you were aiming for while building this product? (It was resume based) 5.Asked me to explain the user flow of a project I worked on. 6.What is your dream company? 7.was majorly asked to explain all Resume projects in detail and asked cross-questions based on it.

## Preparation Resources
1.)Doremon Den Bootcamp 2.)PM School Case Practice Videos 3.)Books like Cracking the PM Interview, Swipe to Unlock, Decode and Conquer 4.)Victor Cheng Case Videos & IITB Case Book for Consulting Cases 5.)GFG & Brainstellar Puzzles

## Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
1.)One thing that helped me this placement season was being determined about my role i.e. Product. In summer 2023, I enrolled myself in a Product Bootcamp- Doremon Den which helped me familiarize with PM concepts. I did a PMIG Project here at IIT Kanpur- which helped me make decks. Plus I participated in a Product Folks hackathon. 2.)While Preparing for PM, consulting or any managerial role- you need to focus on case preparation. Instead of just reading cases from any book, try solving it with your friends. I took help from Seniors & Doremon Den mentors to help me solve mock cases. Also solve cases in a flow chart manner (try to write it for future reference). Later, read/discuss the solution and write the things that you missed to make your solution better. STRUCTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT IN CASES!! 3.)Resume Shortlisting is a major step in getting a PM role. Luckily I had a Product Growth Intern but apart from that I made sure I had at least 1 Product project in my Resume. Use terms like Metrics, User flow, and other product-related terms to highlight. And having POR’s is a plus.
