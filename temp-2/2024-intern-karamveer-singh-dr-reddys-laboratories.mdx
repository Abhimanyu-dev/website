## Insights on the Interview Process
1. The tests were prepared standalone for Mechanical and Chemical students. I took the mechanical exam, which included General Core topics covered in ESO202, TA201, ESO201 and ESO209 and ofcourse JEE mains . The aptitude and reasoning sections were easy to intermediate level, and the exam was simple in terms of foundation however it is always recommended to keep a close check on proctoring techniques. DO NOT CHEAT 2. Around 40-50 Mec students were given the opportunity to engage in GD, which focused on storage and moisture protection techniques. A single room was assigned to around 7-10 students for GD. The essential tenet for cracking the GD was to remain cool, talk judiciously, but boldly and significantly, and to avoid waste and many negative hits. The topic was thermo derivative, which you should be familiar with based on your experience with ESO201 and Class 12th. Their objective is not just to assess your knowledge, but also your speaking and leadership abilities, such as how effectively you can manage a group of intellectuals while accepting their points and delivering a final result to the proctor. SPEAK ONLY IMPORTANT. 3. My technical round began with an intro blunder, which I strongly suggest you not to do; as the saying goes, first impressions are last, but it turned out that the interviewer became interested in my quick and accurate responses; here are a few things I thought worked in my tech round. A). They asked me about my favorite core project, and I had one in AME that I took very seriously. During the resume creation days, I went to the project mentor, Y19 Samarth Sachan, and learned everything there was to know about it. So I described everything for around 15-20 minutes, including some cross-questioning from the interviewer. Which I believe I accomplished with complete joy. B). Before the interview, I did some research on what type of work mech engineers do in DRL and what type of interviewer they send to colleges. I had a sense that one of them would be an alum or someone who had followed the same curriculum as we mec engineers, so I went on to study what most likely questions they would ask, and the same thing happened on my interview desk- they asked me what my job would be if I joined.... Which I murdered. C). They asked me about my explicit and different talent at first, and I told them I am decent at doing fast calculations in my head, so throughout the interview, they were throwing me numbers that they asked me to add, multiply, subtract, or divide, and the answer they revealed at the end after asking me to write mine on a piece of paper... which was correct and I think the highlight of my interview.So, in short be smart enough to LEAD YOUR INTERVIEW 4. My HR round began with the question &quot;We are going to select only one from Mechanial... Why You?&quot; and lasted 15 minutes. Their main goal was to determine how much I like mechanical courses and other related topics, which is something you should be prepared for. Second, they asked me what I knew about DRL and what they did, which I was prepared for. It is also recommended that you contact seniors who have previously completed the internship or are currently working there to learn more about the workings and culture, which we discussed for a reasonable amount of time. Then followed my interests, favorite courses, family information, and PORs. Being an APC in SPO provided me with several anecdotes to speak with HR; in the middle of the interview, we were quite discussing the intern, placement statistics from the previous year, and predictions for the future. At the conclusion, they questioned me about my profile choice, whether manufacturing or RND, and they were constantly forcing me to select manufacturing, but I was fixated on the RND throughout, which I think gave them a sense of my values. He was writing everything down on a piece of paper and then asking me a few questions to see if I had stated anything made up, which I had done effectively because the only thing I was told to remember was DO NOT LIE.
