Milan Anand Raj, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Milan Anand Raj 200584 Double major CSE B Tech student  will do
 summer internship in Databricks profile at Databrick's. Here are some brief
insights.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:

## Insights on the Selection Process
First, a coding test was administered online by Databricks. For someone who has answered a good number of interview questions, it would be simple. The range of Leet code-medium type problems was where the challenge lay. After that, three interviews took place. Two focused on answering and debating coding-related problems. They posed a medium-difficulty Leet code coding question during the first interview session. In the second round, the difficulty of the questions was raised to a level somewhat above that of the Leetcode hard questions. The last round consisted of a technical portion as well as an HR round

## Insights on the Interview Process
In the interviews, they weighed their candidate-ratings more on the constant discussions, the approaches proposed (more than one approach preferrable), code readability. In the second round, I couldn’t implement my approach within the time limit. Thankfully, I had a lot of discussions with the interviewer on that question. And he was fairly satisfied with my approach. So, I was moved to the HR round without complete code implementation. The HR round was mostly on my openness to things, future-plans with some justifications, and my experiences during my resume projects.

## Sample Interview Questions
Leetcode, Codeforces, Interview Bit

##  Preparation Resources
I attempted most of the Code forces contests, solved almost all the Interview bit problems and then moved to solve Leet code questions (Leet code preferrable if you have time left after solving Interview bit)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
