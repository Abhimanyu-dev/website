a.8.5+ CPI

Test
a.Both programming and aptitude questions

Interview Process
a. 3 (In my case), can vary
b. Logical Questions where one had to brainstorm the
entire process.

Perform well in the test is one of the key factors in order to get
selected.","To prepare for internship season, there are two major areas which one needs to practice, CP and Quant.

For CP -
1) Basic - if you are new to coding then first pick up a coding language (preferably C++, read about STL), understand different Data Structures and learn basic algorithms for graphs since
it is one of the favorite topics and build upon it.
2) Advanced – There are different websites where you can practice questions from. I recommend solving Interview Bit since it has many relevant questions. Apart from this I personally used Leetcode during the initial part of preparation and CodeForces towards the end. CP algorithms is a nice resource to widen your coding toolbox.

For Quant –
1) Revision Mso/hso
2) 50 challenging Questions
3) Brain stellar
4) Xinfeng Chau","If you fear giving interviews, then make sure you attend the mock interviews organized by both SPO and AnC Council. It is better to form a peer group while solving CP questions daily since there will be someone with whom you can discuss different approaches to solve the same problem. Always remember that interview is not just how much you know, but how much you can reproduce in a pressure situation. Maintain your nerves during the interview. While discussing the problem statement make sure you understand it perfectly, you need to ask the interviewer about the end cases. Think aloud during the interview so that interviewer can get to know the approach you are using. Start making resume at least a month before the submission and get it reviewed by some seniors."
Arpit Maheshwari,BT,EE,M,SAMSUNG Electronics South Korea,Associate,"Graviton (Quant), Microsoft (SDE), DE Shaw (SDE)","People from CSE and EE branches were allowed to give the coding test

Coding test-
1.) There was 1 coding test of 3 hours duration. The test consisted of 1 question.
2.) The test was not too difficult. The time complexity bounds were also not too tight for the given constraints of the question which essentially meant that brute force solution also worked. Still, it was lengthy and one had to be careful with the edge cases. Apart from the number of test cases passed, the time taken to solve the problem was also a factor which was considered.

Interview-
1) It consisted of 2 rounds - HR and Technical
2) A coding question was asked in the technical round. It was based DP. The problem asked in the interview was based on Knapsack
3) The HR round had general questions like ""Why do you want to work for Samsung?"","" Do you know anything about Korean culture?"", and things based on similar lines.

CGPA plays a crucial role in getting shortlisted. 14 people were shortlisted for the interview, out of which 6 were finally selected. Among those 6 people, 5 were from CSE and 1 from EE. These numbers generally remain similar every year.","1.) For Coding- Interviewbit, leetcode, contests on Codeforces for time-bound practice. 
2.) For Quant- Brainstellar, 50 challenging problems","1.) I would say that first chalk out a plan for yourself because every person is in a
different scenario with varied strengths/ weaknesses, so try and figure out what
works best for you.
2.) Start early so that you have enough time to figure out things and prepare accordingly
3.) Talk to seniors. This is very important since they are the people who have gone
through similar situations and can easily guide you throughout the process.
4.)Finally, don't get bogged down by any hiccups that you may face. Stay focused
and don't let your self-confidence go down. It is easier said than done but then it is
the reality and it matters a lot."

a. All CSE and EE people were eligible
b. Given a single problem and 3hrs to solve it.
c. Largely a brute force question, with some little dp.

2. CPI Shortlist
a.14 people were shortlist after coding round based on CPI

3. Interview
a. Coding nterview:  Easy question based on a variant of maximum subset problem.
b. HR Interview: They basically try to assess how well may you fit the Korean Culture.",Interviewbit and Codeforces,Do Coding and reach out to seniors in case of any help
Somya Lohani,BT,CSE,F,Uber,Software Engineer ,"Microsoft Machine Learning Intern, Google Software Engineer, Microsoft Software Engineer, Sprinklr Software Engineer ","For Microsoft ML, I was extensively quizzed about my past projects which were mostly reinforcement learning based. I was also asked questions on the probability concepts relevant to machine learning and different classification and regression models and where and why those models were relevant. All the software roles that I interviewed for, required me to have a good command on competitive programming and DSA concepts. I had to code the  solutions to the problems in real time. Questions based on OOPS were also frequently asked. For most parts, the companies (Software roles) I interviewed for did not discuss my resume at length. ","Interviewbit, Leetcode Medium level problems, CSES problem set, GFG for topic wise revision of DSA concepts and Machine learning Course by Andrew Ng.  ","The process can be very stressful since luck plays a decent amount of role while getting you through interview shortlists and interviews. The key is to have faith in yourself and surround yourself with a good set of friends who are just as motivated and have your best interests in mind. There is no one model that works for everyone, so spend time figuring out what works for you and follow it religiously. "
Ankit Yadav,BT,ME,M,D.E Shaw India Pvt Ltd,Software Developer,NA,"Questions Related to Dynamic Programming, Graphs and Binary search and very basic questions regarding OOPS were asked.","1) Interview Bit ( Programming and Puzzles)
2) Codeforces( for pclub contests only)
3) CSES Problem Set (to consolidate a topic if enough time is there)
4) Competitive Programming - 3  (BOOK by Steven Halim and Felix Halim)
5) Brainsteller
6) GeeksforGeeks","Most important thing is to have good peer group for discussing questions, find people with common interest, keep giving contests organized by pclub and you must keep learning things which you don't know and due to which you were not able to solve a particular question in company tests and contests. My personal advice would be to First do each and every question from Interview Bit and keep learning things you don't know from geeks for geeks, for graphs and Binary search read theory (no need to do questions if you don't have much time) from the book I mentioned( CP-3 by Halim). For DP do every question from Interview Bit and also do some questions from CSES problem set for building confidence, for quant profile do Brainsteller and interview bit Puzzles, if you get stuck refer to GeeksforGeeks for that question and YouTube if still not clear"
