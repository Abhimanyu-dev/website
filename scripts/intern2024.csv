1.Technical Test – They
asked a fundamental question and tougher questions from topics like DP
and graphs. The deciding factor was their platform usage, since you had
to solve it on their platform without any Autocomplete and had very
different patterns of taking in the input.
2.Round 1 – There was only one question asked to me from Heaps, and
the requirement was to code it and run it on your system to show the
correct output. Its difficulty was almost Leetcode Hard.
3.Round 2(Final) – This was the round where you had to show your
temperament while thinking about things, which, in my opinion, was an
excellent approach to an interview. The interviewer wanted to know
how the person thinks and what their way of optimizing things is. He
made me go through one question, which was just a discussion on how
to solve it, starting from brute force and discussing it up to the level that
it gets very optimized after 4-5 approaches that we discussed. Then
came a lot of basic aptitude-based coding questions that tested out-of-
the-box thinking skills.","I think the key to a good interview is having confidence on your
skills and having a good grasp of DSA. This was crucial for any
interviews that I faced and made a good impact. You must be vocal
about what you feel about the approach you think is right and be
confident enough to switch to a different one if it doesn’t work.

seniors as possible (Y21s, Y20s and if possible Y19s also). Keep updating your

game based on a doc that was shared right before this round.

focused on probability questions and the market making game. Rough
paper was not allowed for any of the rounds, all calculations had to be

questions). Following the shortlist, senior and junior buddies were assigned, with whom I did

the buddy rounds (case studies), and then there was a dinner in Gurugram. Finally, interviews
were scheduled on the Day-1 of internship drive.","For consulting profile in MBB’s, there is resume shortlisting, sometimes may have a test too
(but usually non evaluatory). Once the shortlist is out, there are buddy rounds followed by
dinner or an informal get-together, which is finally followed by interviews. Number of rounds in
interviews vary from company to company, for McKinsey it was 1, BCG-2 and Bain 2-3.
Be calm, confident and conversant in the interviews, and try to think from the perspective of
the interviewer. Questions would either revolve around the case studies or your personality,
resume and experiences.","Bain &amp; Company
- A guesstimate on estimating the size of grocery market industry in Delhi NCR, and
subsequently focusing on estimating the market cap of a retail grocery chain.
- A profitability framework based case study on night store retail chain in Delhi.
- A guesstimate on estimating the number of vaccines required for the next pandemic,
and determining the suitable arrangements that have to be made for the same.

- Questions based on my personality, experiences in college, strengths, weaknesses
and a quick calculation based case (but not exactly a case study)","For Consulting, I prepared by learning from the video playlist by Aaditya Agarwal on YouTube,
and some random YouTube videos on few key concepts. Some CIC videos could also be
seen, to understand the process of how case studies are to be solved in an interview setting.

Practiced with peers from CIC, IIMA and SRCC Casebooks. Did cases with seniors.
Apart from Consulting profile, did coding practice on Interview Bit, and learned from YouTube
playlists. Aptitude and Puzzles were done from 50 challenging Problems in Prob and Stats,
Heard on the Street, Puzzled Quant and BrainStellar. Selected chapters from XinFeng Zhou’s
Quantitative Finance book could also be done for finance and probability.","- Don’t rely on 1 profile only, diversify and prepare for 2-3 roles whole heartedly.
(Ensure that you don’t end up preparing for all too). Selection of roles is difficult, but
elimination is easier.
- Don’t see consulting as an alternative to coding. Preparation for consulting is to be
done from around shortlist time only, do coding and other prep before that.
- Don’t skip the interview tests of other companies, even if you think you’re gonna make
it in one.
- Relax, internships are just a phase, and not an end of the world, so don’t forget to
enjoy your summers too. Good friend circle is really helpful to survive the lonely,
scorching summers on campus (or at home), nd BT mt lo zyada ;-)",,,,,,,

","Six candidates competed for the R&D position in the final round. The interviewer has a big impact on how this round goes. If I remember correctly, the interviewer in our instance holds a PhD from the University of Maryland and was an alum of IITK. He told me straightaway that he would not review my resume or ask HR-related questions. After a brief introduction, we jumped straight to technical questions. ","Questions were tricky and encompassed JEE physics, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics. You must prepare very well for this round. Be thorough with fluids and thermodynamics, mostly ESO201 and a small amount of CHE221/ESO204. Revise the basics such as continuity equation, thermodynamic enthalpies, their significance, etc. He asked me six questions. With a few exceptions that I could only partially explain, the interview proceeded smoothly.

","It is always a good idea to keep your preparation broad. Do not neglect what you've written in your resume, your core courses, and any information about company/role.

Summer Associate - BCG ","Bain and Company
BCG","1)Resume Shortlist
2)Aptitude Test
3) 2 Rounds (In some cases 3) of case interviews 
","Insights on the Selection Process	About 20 people were shortlisted based on resumes. In order to get your resume shortlisted, three things that one can do are:
1) Try to have a diverse resume with 2-3 peaks (peaks essentially mean exceptional performance in various aspects like academics, research, professional experience, social work, PORS, sports, extracurricular activities, etc.).
2) Check out the resumes of your seniors to get a rough idea.
3) It is super important to start the process of making your resume early and getting it proofread by as many seniors as possible. (Don’t hesitate before texting a senior; most people are really helpful and will do it for you.)
The aptitude test does not require any preparation as such. 
 
Our resume submission was around July 13th, and the shortlist was out on July 20th. After this, each one of us was allotted two buddies (they were current Bain employees from IIT Kanpur). 
My seniors had advised me to practice as many cases as possible with the junior buddy and practice at least one case with my senior buddy. These rounds are non-evaluative, so do not hesitate before reaching out to your buddy for a case.
We also had a mock interview before the actual interview. This typically involves senior managers. My interview was about 30 minutes long and started with an introduce yourself question, followed by an e-commerce-related profitability case. 
 
On the final case interview day, I was asked about an unconventional market entry case in the first round. It was about 21 minutes long. The case was that a Canadian cement company wishes to enter India to launch a super app. What, according to you, should be the categories that it should operate in?
In the second round, I was asked a mathematics word problem that included an elaborate set-up about trucks that deliver cement from one site to another, and I was asked to calculate the minimum number of trucks that are required for the job. The interview was about 12 minutes long. 
 
The key here is to try to stay as calm as possible and not be shy as far as asking for details. In the first round, I genuinely panicked because of the nature of the question. However, I began by asking the interviewer to tell me a little bit about what he meant by “super apps.” This gave me some breathing space and also gave direction to the interview. 
In the second round, though the question was lengthy, it was solvable (now that I look back). I quickly finished solving the question and communicated the wrong answer, 15 trucks. However, I luckily realised that my answer was wrong when I was explaining my procedure and quickly corrected it. 
Note that it is not about you being able to solve the question alone; it is also about how well you communicate during the interview and how receptive you are to feedback. Making mistakes is not a problem; however, how you handle the situation after that to fix it matters more. ",,"Theory
1) Aditya Agarwal’s playlist 
2) IITB’s case interview cracked theory videos and mock videos.
 
Practice 
Casebooks: SRCC, IIMA, IITM, IITB
Reach out to as many seniors as possible for mocks once you have practiced about 15 cases with your case group to get better feedback.
The most important part of my preparation were the cases I practiced with my seniors and my case group. It is not just important to practice a case but also important to ask for feedback after the case and analyse the case later to look for ways to improve your approach.
","If you think that your resume is likely to get shortlisted, you can start practicing cases even before the shortlist is out. (Don’t wait for them to start the resume submission process; in our case, the process started pretty late, which gave very little time for people to practice. Even if the shortlist is not out, start practicing in the 1st week of July.).
Try to make a small case group (mine had 3 people) and practice daily with them. (We practiced 1 case per person every day.). 
You can start with guesstimates, then practice profitability, then unconventional cases and then market entry cases. It is recommended to practice at least 10–15 cases in each of these categories. You can possibly have a look at pricing, growth, and mergers as well. 
Ensure that you have practiced your introduction multiple times. Try to mention things you wish to talk about in your introduction. (like your coolest internship, your POR, or your extracurricular activity)

The interviewer was throughout discussing what approach I am using and if there could be any better one and I had to screen share and code in front of him. After this there’s comes the HR round which was also quite extensive around 1 hour where the resume was thoroughly discussed through projects and a keen emphasis was given to the values and team efforts put in projects and the PORs. Interviewer himself asked to discuss one best and kind off worst project from the resume and to share the experiences about them. It is also important to know about the company as they asked few things like why this company, why this role etc. The process was quite different at Edelweiss where the 1st round after OA i.e. a technical round lasted for half an hour in which a lot of python and project related questions were asked. They really focus on the mathematical and statistical aspects of the projects you have done. In the HR as well they were keen to know what out of the box you can think of.","At Atlassian, the question asked was from the topic of Graph algorithms around the DSU. The concepts to be known were DFS, Union by size, Union by rank, should be familiar with OOPs techniques as it was around that only. The other question was related to Linked list, something similar to the ‘LRU Cache’ problem.
At Edelweiss, some function like Maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, Time frame alternation of a given time series (OHLCV) data etc. were along with some theoretical questions like what is PEP8 in python, covariance matrix etc.","For DSA, I used following resources:
1. Interview Bit (Complete)
2. Leet Code (Medium problems and Mock Tests)
3. Striver’s playlist (For Graphs mostly)
4. P-Club Archives, CSES and A2OJ ladder (Some parts of them)
For Prob and Stats (Quite overallping):
1. PuzzledQuant
2. Xinfeng Zhou (Book)
3. Brain Steller
4. MSO/HSO (Mostly pre-midsem)","Do’s:
1. Be very well prepared of your resume, like don’t focus on putting many things, just get a very clear idea of whatever you are putting in and prefer to submit the profile relevant one.
2. Be confident in the interviews, that is the key and try to keep it interactive.
 
Don’ts:
1. Don’t start too much resources at the same time, you will mess up. I preferred to use any one from each bucket mentioned above at a time.
2. Don’t be confused between the profiles you are applying, and make sure to have some backups as well.
 
The simple formula I will advice is to be persistent and think less, you will succeed.

There were 3 rounds, 2 coding and 1 HR round taking around 2 and a half hours. As compared to other companies where he interviewed, he found that the level of questions was slightly more advanced (comparable to leetcode hard problems), however the interviewers were giving hints that helped in making progress. The HR round was quite simple, they asked about his interest in software engineering and asked him to go through one of the web development projects in his resume in detail (like why did you choose this framework, how did you test it, etc.). At the end, they offered him the intern position right there, though he accepted it later after giving 3 more interviews.
 ","There were 2 long coding questions (one each round), the interviewer kept on increasing the question difficulty by introducing new constraints on the problem when he made progress. For Rubrik, he would recommend having some exposure to Competitive Programming but completing most of the hard questions on leetcode should also suffice. Also, try to get a good hold over coding (they were not satisfied by just the algorithm idea, they wanted exact working code), so make sure that you can comfortably code your ideas.

 ","Do’s: 
Start preparing early, because at the end of summer, tests will literally leave no time for skill building. Start at the beginning of summer if you want to learn any new skill/ improve coding.
 
Focus on OOP concepts, they are asked a lot in quant firms (Optiver and alphagrep had a round specifically for OOP).
 
Try to work on good self-projects which you can showcase in your resume as well.
 
Don'ts:
Don’t start everything in the suggested resources at once, and it is fine if you don’t cover all the resources, first focus on understanding the higher level concepts and then practice more questions.
 
If you attempt a coding problem, write actual code and not just the idea, translating your ideas into code is a very important skill in tests and interviews.
 
Don’t just solve the complete question in the mind (applicable to both puzzles as well as coding problems), try to interactively solve them with friends, it improves your ability to express your ideas better.",,,,,,,

Development",,"For Amazon, there was one technical test and then one technical interview
round.
Technical Test:
Consisted of 2 sections- “Coding Assessment” and “Workstyle
Assessment”.
Coding Assessment: 2 coding problems were asked. They required
decent problem-solving and no particular algorithms or data structures
(Kind of similar to Codeforces Div.2 A, B, C).
Workstyle Assessment: based on the Amazon Leadership Principles.
Technical Interview:
There was only 1 interview round. I was asked for my introduction and
then 2 coding problems were given. They were standard problems you
would encounter when practicing InterviewBit, Leetcode etc.
First was a problem on finding a target element in a sorted matrix.
Second was based on finding the “boundary sum” in a Binary Tree.
For Amazon, binary tree is one of the most frequently asked topics.
Additional Advice: Interviewers do not expect the most optimal solution
from the very start. Also, do not assume the things that we usually assume
or encounter when practicing. Ask clarifying questions wherever
appropriate before/ while working on the problem. (e.g., clarify which
elements should be considered to be boundary elements, unless specified)
Ask for what to do if there’s an edge case (e.g., should I print -1 if target
element doesn’t exist?). These skills are important as a Software Dev.
Keep communicating what you’re thinking with the interviewer, they also
help you with hints when you get stuck. One other thing you can work on
for the interviews is the code quality. Make separate functions wherever
applicable. Name the variables and functions appropriately (row, col
instead of i, j when traversing 2D matrix etc.).",,,"Practicing and giving contests on Codeforces, Codechef or Atcoder is helpful for enhancing
problem solving skills, especially for the technical test/ online assessment rounds.
Videos of Striver on YouTube &amp; his SDE sheet for preparing various topics and problems found
on Leetcode, InterviewBit. Very helpful for technical interviews.","Consistency is key. Even when your schedule is busy, fix one 20-minute slot and focus
on problem practice in that time. You can always extend the practice time, but working
for just a few minutes will help you at least do non-zero practice every day!
Spend some time preparing for HR interviews. Research common interview questions
and practice your responses. Try speaking in front of a mirror or camera. You might
struggle with problems or feel awkward when practicing interview responses at first, but
remember, that&#39;s what practice is for.
Some software companies ask for OOPs Concepts. Learn about Object Oriented
Programming and prepare for interview questions based on it.
Luck also plays a big role during the intern season. Do not spend time worrying about
things beyond your control. Focus on what you can actually do right now.
Don’t hesitate to contact your seniors for advice on your roles of interest.",,,,,,,

SDE: P-club Archives are the most important one as it gives you an actual idea about
how the questions are going to be. Any standard SDE sheet that covers all the topics and
basic questions like Striver’s. Practice thoroughly either on the interviewbit ladder or
Leetcode (p.s. try doing 2 easy 3 medium 1 hard from all the topics). After this, one can
refer to CSES problemset for completion and revision. Contests on standard platforms
like CF, CC, Atcoder maybe helpful and is completely optional. Might help in time and
accuracy.
Core/FMCG: Be thorough with the courses that you have done. Especially for ME, CHE,
AE, topics like Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Elementary Solid Mechanics might be
a good point to start over. GDs form a chunk of the selection process. Take advise from
seniors and form a group targeting for the role to have mock GD sessions under senior’s
guidance. Case studies of Group Discussions maybe found on the internet. (e.g. Should
a particular worker be fired or not among a diverse group of workers?) Try reading
through several such articles and practice few GDs in person to familiarize yourself.
Miscellaneous: To broaden the spectrum, it is recommended to go through an adequate
number of puzzles on sites like GFG, brainstellar and puzzledquant. It comes to help in
interview rounds of analyst roles, quant-based firms and several others as well. If time
permits, it mightbe a good idea to skim over MSO201 (Probability and Statistics) notes,
some acquaintance with concepts like OOPS, DBMS, OS (might refer small playlists
available on youtube) that mightbe helpful in subsequent interviews.","Do not compare yourself with others. Keep working hard along the line whatever you
have decided. Try to be collaborative and keep a learning attitude with your peers.
2. Do not try to do a lot many things simultaneously. Segregate few specific roles and
work in that direction. Reach out to seniors who are in those roles and communicate.
3. Be confident in your interviews. No interviewer expects you to be perfect. Making
mistakes or not knowing something in the interview is absolutely okay, you just need to
keep your calm through the rest of it.
4. Be prepared completely about each and every word that is mentioned in your resume.
Failure to comply comes out as a negative impression and avoid any such thing.
5. Keep yourself composed mentally throughout the entire process. It is like a journey
where be for the people, take help from parents, friends and everyone. Try to work
sincerely five to six hours on a daily basis and substantial changes would be evident.",,,,,,,

For Texas Instruments, the Analog part was quite easy and
based on whatever we studied by the end of 4 th sem, and for the
digital part, it was mostly based on signals, modulation, and
problems based on time and frequency domain. 2.
The test of NoBroker is easy to crack with just simple mental
ability questions. 3.
For Qualcomm, the questions are a bit easier, all from whatever
has been covered. The major portion was solving circuits, logic
gates, inverters, etc. 4.
For Samsung Research, time is the key for cracking the test and
rest we were given 3 simple DSA-based questions which you
can solve within 45-50min with a basic understanding of DSA
(Question type: CP)","For all the above companies process is clearing a test and then an
interview and better keep CPI>7","1. For Texas they asked basic questions based on circuits like
voltage and current, then went for a charging graph of a
capacitor under some specific conditions in a specific
circuit. (Tip: they ask you to annotate your solution on the
screen, so arrange a touchscreen laptop for the same)
2. For Qualcomm, questions again are mostly about gates and
inverters. Also, before asking a question they make sure
that you have studied at least something about whatever
they are about to ask.
3. For Samsung, they asked a basic question based on Trees
and then since my profile was mostly ML-based, they asked
many questions based on probability, expected value,
variance, etc. Then, ask to explain any two projects in your CV with as many details as possible. After explanation, they
will cross-question your understanding and ask what
problems you faced, how to tackle them, etc.","You should be able to solve the first 3 questions of CodeForces Div.2 Round for the Samsung

the shortlist based on resume reviews and a coding assessment. After
that, there was just one interview round, which included both technical
and HR questions.","The selection process was quite smooth, with no complex
procedures—just a coding test and a single interview round lasting
about 50-60 minutes. I thought it was efficient because it didn&#39;t take up
too much of your time.","For the questions section, I would say that most of the queries were
related to my resume and the projects I had worked on. For example, if
I mentioned using ML in a project, they asked about the specific
approaches and tools I used, among other details. The interviewer
seemed particularly interested in ML-related topics. I was also asked a
data structures and algorithms (DSA) question related to graphs, so
having a solid understanding of DSA is essential (you should at least be
familiar with platforms like Interview Bit or Leet Code). As for my
preparation, I used Interview Bit for DSA, and for ML, I relied on the
knowledge I gained from my projects.",,"Samsung R&amp;D is the company that selected me, but you might be interested in hearing why I
wasn&#39;t selected by other companies that interviewed me before this.
My first interview was with Goldman Sachs. It was my first interview ever, so I was extremely
nervous, and my preparation wasn&#39;t great—I struggled with coding and, more importantly, with
probability and statistics. I want to emphasize that MSO201, which covers probability and
statistics, is a crucial part of your preparation. The interviewer spent almost 30 minutes asking
me about MSO concepts. So, if you&#39;re aiming for companies like Goldman Sachs, you must
be confident in your coding skills, which only comes with thorough preparation, and you
should have a solid understanding of MSO topics. This knowledge is also helpful for roles like
quant analyst.
The next interview was with Adobe, which was purely coding-based. Since I wasn&#39;t well-
prepared for coding, I struggled and was rejected.
The third interview was for a Qualcomm SDE role. During the interview, they mainly asked me
about concepts from ESC201, EE200, and EE250. This was the best interview I ever had, but
in the end, they only selected candidates from the CSE for the SDE role, as far as I recall.
In conclusion, if you&#39;re confident in your skills, your interviews will likely go well. However, if
you&#39;re underprepared, you&#39;ll find it challenging. My advice is to prepare thoroughly and stay
calm during interviews. Good luck and prepare well!",,,,,,,

Round 1: Resume cum Form round
In this round, students are asked to fill out an online form known
as the ‘ULIP Application Form’. Based on the resume and the form
response, a branch-wise shortlist is made for each profile offered.
Round 2: HireVue round
HireVue is a hiring platform used to conduct video interviews.
Unlike a normal interview, there is no live/actual interviewer on the
other side in a HireVue video interview. In the HireVue video
interview, there are a total of 3 questions. For each question, the
question text is displayed for 2 minutes. In these 2 minutes, the
candidate must analyze the question thoroughly and prepare an
in-depth answer. After those 2 minutes, the candidate is asked to
speak the prepared answer in 3 minutes. The candidate&#39;s answer
is video recorded.
Each profile (RnD, Supply Chain, Tech) has its own set of 3
questions. Each candidate in a given profile is asked the same set
of questions.
Based on the performance of the candidates, a profile-wise
shortlist is made. Here, no branch considerations are made for a
profile.
Round 3: Final Interview
The final interview is an interview with a senior manager at HUL.
The interview may be conducted online or offline. In my case, it
was conducted online.
There is no HR round.","Round 1: Resume cum Form round
a. The shortlisting committee favors candidates with a high
CPI and all-round experience acquired through projects,
PORs, and other activities. The candidate must try to
showcase as many achievements as possible in the
resume.

b. The form contains multiple questions about the candidate’s
achievements (academic and non-academic), aspirations,
passions, philosophies, etc. The form plays a major role in
this round. The answer to each question is read in detail by
the shortlisting committee at HUL. The shortlisting
committee at times overlooks the candidate&#39;s CPI if the
form is well-written.
c. Many times, applicants are overwhelmed by the number
and types of questions (a filtering tactic used by the
organization). Therefore, one must exercise patience. A
smart approach would be to ask seniors for the previous
year&#39;s questions and prepare answers beforehand.
d. Unilever requires genuine candidates, thus one must
ensure that the answers are original. The candidate must
refrain from plagiarizing from online websites or any AI
chatbot because sometimes the language presented by
such sources is unrealistically professional and formal.
This may arouse suspicion by the shortlisting committee.
(Trust me, people have not been shortlisted because of
going down such paths.)
e. HUL generally &quot;PREPONES&quot; the form deadline, so one must
not wait until the last minute.
Round 2: HireVue Round
a. The questions in the HireVue Round can be situation-based
or purely technical. (Sample questions are given in the
sample interview questions section of this article.)
b. The applicant must ask previous year candidates about the
questions that were asked.
c. For Situation-based questions, (specifically for supply
chain and tech roles), candidates can go through Unilever’s
website, study online about supply chain, challenges in the
supply chain, operations, processes, and parameters of
launching a new product, HUL’s work in Digital
Transformation, and Sustainability.
d. For Technical questions, (specifically for supply chain and
tech roles), candidates can review their core courses. CHE
and ME students can review heat and mass transfer,
thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics. EE students can
review machines and power systems.
e. A strong internet connection should be ensured to avoid
hassle.
f. The candidate must remain calm throughout and give their
best.

Round 3: Final Interview
The final interview is highly personality-based. This round is
characterized by resume grueling, questions from core courses,
and HR questions.","The following questions were asked from me during SPO
internship drive 2023:
Sample questions from the form
1. What have you been deeply passionate about, how much
time do you spend on it and what has been the outcome?
2. Tell us about one strength of yours that distinguishes you.
3. Any niche skills or advanced knowledge in a subject that
would be relevant to the area of internship

Sample HireVue Round Questions
1. HUL is planning to launch a global hair care brand
which has been a huge success in UK due to its unique
and trending formulation. As an Innovation planning
manager, partnering the Beauty &amp; Personal care
innovations team, you need to decide the supply chain
strategy for this innovation. The market size for this
product in India is very niche and is less than 10% of the
market size in UK. Evaluate all the strategies mentioned
below based on their merits and demerits and finalize
the strategy best suited for this launch. You can make
assumptions for some factors to complete the
evaluation a. Manufacture the product at your own
facility. b. Outsource the production to a 2P/3P. c.
Import the product from UK
2. Explain the working of an induction motor. Explain the
relationship between poles and angular speed of an

 how to answer typical HR related questions in general.
 GD: It is beneficial to either go first and explain the problem or
 question to everyone or go last to summarize every detail
 discussed and explain the conclusion reached. Try and make sure
 that you don’t abruptly interrupt someone or that you don’t
 disregard someone’s opinion entirely, in case you disagree with
 
 someone explain politely your reasons and points you disagree
 on. Try to continue from where previous person left off.
 Interview: In HR round you are asked to go through your resume
 and explain each point (Projects, competitions, PoR and extra
 curriculars) on your resume in brief. They ask you if you faced any
 major obstacle you faced while doing any project and how you
 tackled it. Try to make a story out of your resume and explain each
 project likewise.",,"Core Stuff: Going through notes of the courses taught in 2 nd year will be suffice. Just make sure
 that your concepts are clear in these courses.
 Mental Ability: Solving previous year CAT questions can help. In my case going through puzzles
 section of Interviewbit and solving Brainstellar helped a lot.
 GD: Joining sessions organized by AnC and SPO for GD practice would help a lot. You can also
 practice GDs with your friends in general, just make sure you have a senior who joins to guide
 and explain you how to proceed in a GD.","Dos:
 · Try to narrow down the profiles you are targeting as early as possible, narrowing down
 preparation to 2-3 profiles is better.
 · Having a diverse profile helps a lot in case of core jobs.
 · Try to have atleast one project related to domain you are targeting.
 Don’ts:
 · Try not to rely completely on profiles like Techno-managerial and Consulting as
 
 shortlisting in these profiles are highly uncertain. Always have a backup in case you
 are targeting these profiles.
 · Don’t write anything on your resume that you are unsure of, make sure that you are
 thorough with your resume.",,,,,,,

finally, one interview round. The test was relatively manageable, with coding questions of

medium difficulty—around three, if memory serves correctly. I managed to solve two of them.
Before the coding section, there was a timed aptitude segment, where we had to tackle as
many questions as possible. The format involved an interesting twist: Correct answers
increased the difficulty of subsequent questions, while incorrect answers decreased it.","My interview lasted approximately 45-50 minutes. It consisted of a single round, primarily
focusing on my resume. With notable projects and a brief internship at a startup, the
interviewers delved deeply into each aspect. They requested detailed explanations of every
project, emphasising my machine learning (ML) project. The remaining time was dedicated to
discussing my web development project and internship experience. Interestingly, there were
no coding questions, and the interview was conducted by two interviewers. All questions were
technical in nature, without any behavioural inquiries.",,"I focused most of my preparation efforts during the summer. However, I had also completed a
DSA course during the 4th semester and regularly practiced competitive programming, which
helped improve my coding skills. I primarily used InterviewBit for resources and continued
practicing competitive programming in May. Additionally, during this time, I worked on an ML

GD Round (30 min) amond Mec students. 3.
Technical Interview Round ( 40 min) 4.
HR Round (80 min)","1. The tests were prepared standalone for Mechanical and Chemical students. I
took the mechanical exam, which included General Core topics covered in
ESO202, TA201, ESO201 and ESO209 and ofcourse JEE mains . The aptitude
and reasoning sections were easy to intermediate level, and the exam was
simple in terms of foundation however it is always recommended to keep a
close check on proctoring techniques. DO NOT CHEAT
2. Around 40-50 Mec students were given the opportunity to engage in GD,
which focused on storage and moisture protection techniques. A single room
was assigned to around 7-10 students for GD. The essential tenet for cracking
the GD was to remain cool, talk judiciously, but boldly and significantly, and to
avoid waste and many negative hits. The topic was thermo derivative, which
you should be familiar with based on your experience with ESO201 and Class
12th. Their objective is not just to assess your knowledge, but also your
speaking and leadership abilities, such as how effectively you can manage a
group of intellectuals while accepting their points and delivering a final result
to the proctor. SPEAK ONLY IMPORTANT.
3. My technical round began with an intro blunder, which I strongly suggest
you not to do; as the saying goes, first impressions are last, but it turned
out that the interviewer became interested in my quick and accurate
responses; here are a few things I thought worked in my tech round.
A). They asked me about my favorite core project, and I had one in AME that I
took very seriously. During the resume creation days, I went to the project mentor, Y19
Samarth Sachan, and learned everything there was to know about it. So I described
everything for around 15-20 minutes, including some cross-questioning from the
interviewer. Which I believe I accomplished with complete joy.
B). Before the interview, I did some research on what type of work mech engineers do
in DRL and what type of interviewer they send to colleges. I had a sense that one of
them would be an alum or someone who had followed the same curriculum as we mec
engineers, so I went on to study what most likely questions they would ask, and the
same thing happened on my interview desk: they asked me what my job would be if I

joined.... Which I murdered.
C). They asked me about my explicit and different talent at first, and I told them I am
decent at doing fast calculations in my head, so throughout the interview, they were
throwing me numbers that they asked me to add, multiply, subtract, or divide, and the
answer they revealed at the end after asking me to write mine on a piece of paper...
which was correct and I think the highlight of my interview.So, in short be smart
enough to LEAD YOUR INTERVIEW
4. My HR round began with the question &quot;We are going to select only one
from Mechanial... Why You?&quot; and lasted 15 minutes. Their main goal
was to determine how much I like mechanical courses and other related
topics, which is something you should be prepared for. Second, they
asked me what I knew about DRL and what they did, which I was
prepared for. It is also recommended that you contact seniors who have
previously completed the internship or are currently working there to
learn more about the workings and culture, which we discussed for a
reasonable amount of time. Then followed my interests, favorite
courses, family information, and PORs. Being an APC in SPO provided
me with several anecdotes to speak with HR; in the middle of the
interview, we were quite discussing the intern, placement statistics from
the previous year, and predictions for the future. At the conclusion, they
questioned me about my profile choice, whether manufacturing or RND,
and they were constantly forcing me to select manufacturing, but I was
fixated on the RND throughout, which I think gave them a sense of my
values. He was writing everything down on a piece of paper and then
asking me a few questions to see if I had stated anything made up,
which I had done effectively because the only thing I was told to
remember was DO NOT LIE.",,,up. Just start with one channel and if you are understanding then continue with this .,,,,,,,

Interview consisted of case based questions.
2. JPMC shortlisting was based on the online test. The interview
questions were reasoning and maths based.
3. My Uber shortlist was through Uber She++. Google shortlisted on the
basis of branch (CSE,EE,MTH,SDS). Both Uber and Google asked
DSA questions in the interviews.","1. For Consulting, only start doing case prep after you get a
shortlist, there will be enough time. The cases asked in the actual
interview will be very different from the ones you see during
preparation. It is all about structuring your thoughts and asking
relevent questions so that the interviewer understands your
thought process.
2. For JPMC, brainstellar might be of help. In my interview, the
interviewer was making up reasoning and analytical problems
based on my projects.
3. For Google and Uber, they give slightly changed versions of
questions from interviewbit. They basically test how well you
understand the questions, whether you can think of possible
solutions, write the code and if you can change the solution to
accomodate any other features they tell you later.","1. BCG – IITM case book and cases provided by seniors and BCG
mentors themselves.
2. JPMC – Brainstellar. Resume questions were about neural
networks and eigenvalues, Math question – “Given a random
number generator that generates a value between 0 & 1, how will
you find the value of pi?”, and other simpler reasoning problems.
3. Google & Uber – Questions were based on graph and tree
traversal and were similar to interviewbit questions. Some of the
test questions were above InterviewBit/LeetCode level.","Interviewbit, IITM case book, Brainstellar, MSO201 notes and CS771 refresher for prob stats.","Figure out which roles you have an interest in, rather than preparing for all the roles.
If you are targetting SDE, try to cover topics like graphs, trees and dp as soon as possible.
Majority of the questions in tests and interviews are from these topics. The tests are much
more difficult than leetcode/interviewbit so be prepared.
The most important thing is to stay calm during interviews. Think out loud, be polite, listen to
the interviewer’s hints and advice while solving the questions.",,,,,,,

Shortlist -&gt; 2 rounds of Interviews.
• Lengthy form, I vaguely remember giving some sort of skill-
assessment test which was gamified.
• Group Discussion was based on the same question that was given
by ITC last year.
• 1st round of Interview was based on some questions related to
projects and not-very-deep theoretical questions related to core
mechanical course like thermodynamics, dynamics and fluids.
• Interview panel consisted of a technical interviewer (IITK alum) and an
HR interviewer.
• Some family background and candidate background questions.
• I would say that they were looking for someone with more project/work
experience in the core field.
• For core questions, revise basic concepts in thermodynamics like
plots, engines, pumps, refrigerator, etc and dynamics and fluids like
boundary layer, evaporation, etc.
• Very few questions related to team management/ leadership questions
related to the PORs that I had mentioned.
• Did not make it to the second round of interviews.

Oracle : Application Form -&gt; Coding Test -&gt; Shortlist -&gt; 4 rounds of
Interviews
• Nominal form
• The coding round was held offline in a lecture hall and was not
proctored on the platform. There were 3 questions of increasing
difficulty. The first two questions were of medium difficulty and the last
one was hard.
• Interview shortlist comes for two positions - Server Tech and
Application Developer.
• First Round - Introduction -&gt; 1-2 generic medium-difficulty coding

questions to solve on paper and explain -&gt; I was lucky to be asked
some questions about my department related to 3D printing and
manufacturing based on the interviewers interest -&gt; I was asked about
my PORs
• Second Round - Was asked to pick my preferred data structure and
asked to generate a coding question and solve it on the spot.
• Third Round - Generic questions related to high-school probability and
statistics like histograms, medians and what is the chance that…?,
etc. Mainly, a SQL task related to performing one of the joins was
given (inner join as far as I remember).
• Fourth Round - HR round. Were you born and brought up in India? Do
you want to go for higher studies? Are you an Indian citizen?","Core Companies
Revise course content well before your interview.
• Prepare for group discussions by partaking in mocks conducted by
AnC and otherwise conduct some amongst your friends for better
practice.
• Be polite and confident, allow people to speak, do not interrupt
anybody. If you start speaking along with somebody else, step back
and reserve your spot after the present speaker.
• Do not repeat what somebody else has already said. Be present in the
conversation and if you want to, acknowledge and appreciate that
someone else has already made this point before and add on to that
point.
• Commencing the discussion by laying out a broad plan of action or
flow, moderating the discussion and concluding the discussion will
earn you cookie points.
• Thermodynamics - Sketch the plot of a Rankine/Carnot/Otto/Brayton
cycle, efficiency formulas, 2/4-stroke engine functions, etc
• Fluids - boundary layer separation criterion, evaporation
• Dynamics - How to estimate the velocity output of a robotic arm given
the forces on applied on the arm.
• Will ask you detailed questions on your project. Prepare according to
STAR approach and be ready to answer follow up questions.
• If you do list it down, you will be asked rigorous technical questions
pertaining to your involvement in a SnT club or team.

Software Companies
• Revise InterviewBit before going to the Interview.

• Cover all the popular medium and some hard questions pertaining to
every topic especially graphs, trees, lists and arrays.
• Learn all the popular algorithms and how to write, at least, the main
block of code of the algorithm.
• You should know how to dry run your code and explain it to another
person.
• Practice thinking out loud and writing your solutions visually on paper.
• For DSA preparation, choose either Leetcode or InterviewBit. I prefer
InterviewBit due to its lovely bucketing of questions topic-wise and
overall point-based approach to learning DSA.
• Try to cover either of the two platforms well before the Internship
season starts and keep revising problems.
• Attempt contests on Codeforces or similar platforms, a good rating on
these platforms speaks volumes about your ability.
• Attempt the previous Absolver contests offered by PClub and partake
in the ones that they conduct throughout the summers.
• Do
•

Learn SQL, basics + types of join from short YouTube tutorials. Should
take a few hours at max.
•

For DSA, Striver’s or Luv’s playlist is standard.
•

If you are stuck on specific InterviewBit/LeetCode questions, you
should find some variant of the question on Google or YouTube.",,Listed above.,"• Revise your projects well, learn to describe your project experience using the
S.T.A.R. (Story/Background. Task/Goal. Approach. Result/Outcome) approach. A
good background story always helps!
• Review the tech stack that the company prefers. Ask seniors if the company asks
questions about specific things for eg. Oracle questioned candidates about SQL
apart from DSA.
• Review requirements listed by the company, ask seniors for the type of questions
that the company asks etc.
• Don’t underestimate the importance of InterviewBit in your preparation.
• Prepare your resume thoroughly. You should be able to describe and defend every
line of your resume.
• Don’t skip to the solution if you are stuck on a problem on LeetCode/ InterviewBit.
Instead, persist for a while and try to figure the logic on your own. This has a
propelling impact on your preparation.",,,,,,,

I was not shortlisted at the start for many companies. I was shortlisted for McKinsey and waitlisted for Millenium. I gave my interview at millenium and was able to crack all the rounds. The HR round however didn't go that well and they had to go with the other candidate. After that I gave interviews at databricks, finmechanics and Barclays. I got my free at Barclays after a long 6 hours of interview process.",,"It consisted of 4 rounds including HR one. The first round tested my mathematics which was easy. It was on basic linear algebra and probability with some puzzles.
The second round was about the resume and general interests. They grilled me on my Projects and asked me some questions on DSA as well. They also asked some ML questions.
Third round was about my dreams and interests and a little DSA.
(I think it was the first two rounds that mattered the most)

The fourth one was the HR round where they were trying to make me nervous and checking my diplomacy. They asked just a single question about the company and the rest about myself.","Leetcode

","There is a way to actually do all of it altogether and do well enough. The first step is definitely making sure you know the syllabus, the next step being practice practice. The way to practice is by doing questions side by side learning topics.
Interviewbit offers a very good way of doing this because of its interface. Side by side it's good to check out the medium and hard problems in leetcode as they are good to have done. To make your preparation stand out, you can actually document the questions you do on notion, of leetcode. There are plenty of resources available for this. coming to the puzzles and all, you can either solve it all at once or a few everyday but you need to be consistent about it",,,,,,,

increase the difficulty as you answer, for the same question. I was
interviewed for a software role. Generally, there were 3 rounds (~40
mins). But in my case, I could solve all the variants of one question in
about 20 mins. (PS. It was a very very hard problem – DP on graphs).
So, had only 1 round and the interviewer been so impressed that he
told me that I will be getting the offer during the interview.","Also, they do check your resume and question you if they find some
PORs (why were you so involved in extra-curriculars) and also if you
don’t have a 9+ CPI, and why GS, why not other firms? but these are
just secondary questions. They don’t care much what you answer, but
they see your confidence level. These are just secondary things. If you
solve the coding questions, that will fetch you the offer. GS does not
expect you to code, or check the syntax, also I didn’t even write the
whole pseudo code on paper. I explained my approach and my
interviewer was happy with that. They just want to check how you
approach the problem and your logic. One special thing about GS was
they have 2 roles – Quant and Software, but they interview for a role
which they feel fits for you, not the case with other companies, and then
your interviewer is the one who will be one of your team members
(manager/associate) when you join. So, it depends on him if he thinks
he needs you in his team, he will roll out an offer. Is it good or bad? – I
leave it on you :)","GOLDMAN SACHS -
A maze of 1s and 0s and you can only travel on 1s
• Return if path exists from 0,0 to n,n
• Return shortest path
• Shortest path if any one 0 can be traveled
• Shortest path if any k 0s is allowed
MICROSOFT –
• Some islands cluster question, again its variant asked later
was dp + graphs.
• Again 1 round like gs of ~20 mins, type and run your code,
and your good to go (got the offer)
• How to reduce space complexity for Visited vector was also
asked (answer is changing 1s to 0s, don’t keep a vector
then)
Google –
• Round 1 was some greedy algo question. Some jobs
scheduling.
• Round 2 was graphs, dfs + trees knowledge.
• Google is so much about clean code. So good coding
practices help, no need to compile, just write a clean code
JPMC analytics –
• Probs + stats stats stats
• Some very basic dp question
• A puzzle – x accidents in 1 hr, how much in half hour (very
easy one)
JPMC Quant –
• Was in JP Morgan quant mentorship program
• Had coding questions (dsu, or I would say they ask the
toughest coding question out of all what you mention on
resume)
• OOPS (2 rounds entirely on OOPS only)
Graviton –
• questions were direct from 50 CP. My interviewer was late
so when he arrived, he opened screenshots of questions
and all were from 50 CP and he asked me a question from
heard on the street iirc also, it was there are 2 urns and if 2
red balls were picked from one then blue is added, if both
different then nothing .. something like this
• But later when I answered this, he asked 2 more questions

on this, it was like - Which ball can have 100% probability to
remain at last and what should be the relation between balls
for 100% probability for a blue ball?
• All 4 cases red even, blue odd, .... and so on were
to be considered
• There was resume discussion for 20 mins. I had a project
on data science in JPMC mentorship program. He
discussed everything about the project, also the
hyperparameter tuning part, and how the output be different
if gamma or kernel were this. And also about
algos done in cs771
Microsoft TPM –
• It was all about resume, general talks
• I had a very interesting project (I got the offer quite easily,
not to brag). If you'd like to discuss it further, feel free to
give me a call.","Coding: Interview bit (covered almost all the questions), Leetcode

only thing in your hand is coding. Don’t waste these 3 crucial months in summer.
• Build your resume for at least 3 profiles. Get it verified by many many many seniors. I
sent my resumes to > 20 seniors.
• Do coding and puzzles, both daily (set your slots).
• Give mock interviews. I gave it to some seniors as well as some organizations to help
you in this. I had already applied off campus before main intern drive, so had an
experience of interview in more than 10 corporates/ startups. This helped me so much
that I was not at all nervous in any of my interviews on day 1.
• Be confident in your interview. Think loud. Talk about whatever you are thinking.
• Take your time, ask time if you want to think on some question. Don’t sit quite and
start thinking. If you need time, ask for it, that won’t look bad then.
• If you know the answer to a question, don’t say that you have solved the question
earlier (obviously).
• Ask questions at the end of the interview. Whenever I say this, people think about
what to ask. Don’t ask dumb questions.
Best is – ask your feedback. They will feel you are brave enough to ask.
Interact with the interviewer. Ask about what he does in the company.
Or ask what skills you need before joining next year – seems like you are interested in
joining the company

I think that’s all. If someone reading this wants to contact me, feel free to reach out
anytime. I will be more that happy to share more gyaan xD.
