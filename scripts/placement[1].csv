Python program was as basic as coding fibonacci series upto nth term. A medium SQL query question, where they mainly focused on the logic building ability, as I didn’t remember the syntax but could partially solve it with the hints that they were dropping, I was considered. Some theoretical SQL questions like GROUP BY vs HAVING clause, Aggregate functions in SQL and so on. ML questions were based on Decision tree, bagging vs boosting(Very imp. Concepts from interview point of view). 2nd Round(60 mins) was divided into 2 segments 1st was an ML breadth and depth segment(30 mins), 2nd was a case study segment(30 mins). In the 1st segment the interviewer asked all sorts of ML questions like Ensemble learning(again v. important), generative modeling vs discriminative modeling, evaluation metrics like precision and recall and what would be used in a spam filter,regularization techniques etc. and DL questions on gradient descent, backprop, objective functions that are used in LLM(This was asked as I had been working on LLM for my thesis, plus it is the hot topic of today’s time), role of filters and pooling layers in CNN and so on. The 2nd segment was a case study on Zomato food delivery. This was more of a discussion session, where they didn’t want the exact solution but wanted to figure out what was my thinking process to approach the solution. The initial discussion revolved around data pre-processing/engineering, like what features to be kept and discarded. And after about 20 mins they emphasized on the model building approach.","1) DSA from Striver sheet 2) Aptitude from Prepinsta, gfg 3) SQL from Leetcode 4) ML and Data Science (CS771, CampusX, blogs in towards data science, analytics vidhya, machine learning mastery are notable few, some design/case study questions can also be prepared)","1. Prepare ML and DL basics really well, as for fresher hire they drill you on the basics. 2. SQL is a must if you’re aiming for DS roles ( I regret not preparing for it enough!!). 3. Think of bridging theory and practice, again this will help in case study rounds. 4. Some good projects demonstrating your knowhow and expertise always helps. 5. Do keep a backup plan in your head(even if it’s hypothetical), which will relieve a lot of stress during interviews. (A small mental hack)) 1. Don’t solely prepare for Data Science roles even if you’re eyeing for one, rather keep the preparation general(by that I mean prepare for 2 other roles, which will give you an opportunity to face more interviews), and you can always switch/hunt for your preferred role later, while having an offer in your hand. 2. Don’t let disappointments and despair get the better of you. Even if you see your mates getting placed while you’re struggling, try holding onto the idea that “you’ll sail through somehow”. YOUR TURN WILL COME, AND SOME OF THOSE MATES WILL BE YOUR GREATEST CHEERLEADERS!!"

Believe me, the only thing you gonna be evaluated on is how much dedicated you were to learn in your college days. Based on the department you belong to, any interviewer would ask you basics from subjects you had in your graduation to assess whether you were genuinely interested in the knowledge your field of study provided you or not. Be confident Interviewers completely understand the anxious state of your mind as you would be appearing for first interviews of your life. Most of the interviewers are mature enough to let you settle down by simply talking about anything you like before they get into the real stuff. But, some interviewers do expect you to be confident on your own. One strategy I used to follow was acting to be confident. When you act like you are confident, it eventually makes you confident in real. Be honest while making your resume Many freshers commit mistake of adding all the fancy points in their resume to impress the interviewer. Believe me, this might backfire on you. An interviewer uses that piece of paper to find out in what domain he can ask you questions. If you add any bluff, there are high chances you would be caught and therefore reducing your chances to get placed. So, make sure you add only what you are confident about in your resume. Think before you answer It wouldn't matter if you take sometime to think before you answer. But if you blabber unclear answer without thinking how to put it forward and explain it clearly, it's surely gonna create a wrong impression even if you knew the answer. Frame the sentence well in your mind and then deliver your answer in a crisp way. Taking those extra 5 seconds to frame a sentence will help you a lot. Prepare well for apti Most of the companies ask for apti in the first round. Make sure you regularly find time to practice those, in order to have an edge over other candidates for clearing the apti. Don't take 'areas of interest' in your resume lightly Many candidates lose their chance because of this. Make sure you add the topics you are most strong in and are genuinely interested in, under the areas of interest. It doesn't always have to be some trending technologies or research topic. Anything that you think you can have a higher level discussion with interviewer on can be added as your areas of interest. An interviewer expects you to have fairly good knowledge about the topics you add in your areas of interest, as those are the topics the interviewer assumes you are genuinely interested in and would have done some decent research on. For example, in my case, I loved competitive coding. So I added simple topics like competitive coding, data structures and design and analysis of algorithm as my areas of interest and never had a problem discussing those topics with interviewers. Don't lose hope even if you get rejected multiple times Last but not the least, no matter what, don't stop yourself from preparing for interviews even after you get rejected multiple times. You can whine or cry over it, but don't stop trying. Keep asking yourself what went wrong the last time and improve yourself on that. Just never give up. I hope these points will be helpful."
Jasjot Singh,200468,N.A.,Jasjot Singh BT CSE 200468,Goldman Sachs,"Companies NK Securities, Sprinklr, Cohesity, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs","The selection process for most companies includes an online coding test followed by interviews on day one. Some companies like HFTs place a CPI shortlist as well for sitting in the test (this is around 8 or 8.5 in most cases). Online assessments start after midsems in September so I tried to solve as many coding problems during that period as possible. If you have multiple interviews on day one, you have to be smart about your scheduling of interviews. Have a preference order in your mind and give interviews according to that, since you might not be able to give an interview in all your shortlisted companies due to clashes.",N.A.,"NK Securities Egg Dropping Problem, start with 2 eggs, then 3 eggs version. Later on, asked a version based on infinite floors. Then a hard coding problem based on graphs. Goldman Sachs Firstly, I was asked questions based on my resume, specifically the work I had done in my intern and a finance project. Most banks and quants will grill you on any finance project that you mention in your resume so prepare well for it. In the second round, I was asked an optimisation problem and then some questions based on probability and statistics. The questions were medium-hard and I was able to do them all. Cohesity I was asked to screen share and do a live coding problem based on smartly using some data structures (sort of a system design problem where I had to process some data efficiently based on given constraints), the problem was doable.","For coding, I focused on solving Leetcode problems as much as possible. Another important resource was Programming club archives. They have some really good questions that were asked in coding tests of companies previously so make sure you do all of those problems. They have contests of 1.5 hours with 3 problems in each, so attempt within the time given to handle time well during the actual assessments. One can also do competitive programming from CodeForces during preparation for developing their problem-solving skills and handling time pressure. For quant, solve all problems from the book Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability and then move on to problems from Xinfeng Zhou. The first book has very few problems but you have to understand the basics of all the problems really well because you will not be asked those questions straightforward in most scenarios. They will ask you the standard version and then build up to an advanced and tougher problem which can only be solved if you know logic really well.","If you are targeting certain companies, go to their Glassdoor page or ask seniors and get some information about what questions they have previously asked in OAs. It’s very likely that they will repeat some topics. Always prepare for placements in a small group and help each other as much as possible.

In guesstimates, the interviewer was not looking for hard figures or calculations, but rather a structured approach and attention to detail (say, for example, figuring an edge case out – an example would be to solve for a metric dip in Spotify and not forgetting to count in podcasts!) In product design problems, coming up with innovative insights to the problem based on personal experience, or recommending novel solutions seemed to leave a good impression on the interviewer. It goes on to show that the candidate has a strong sense of products, in general. Overall, I consider a basic knowledge of technology and digital products and how they work, a necessary element to navigating this interview.","Product Design - 1. In India, there are challenges related to legal awareness and accessibility. Individuals often lack information about their legal rights and processes, such as renting an apartment or filing taxes. Furthermore, the accessibility of legal proceedings is hindered by the difficulty of finding qualified lawyers and booking public interest litigations (PILs). Design a digital product designed to address these issues by improving access to legal information, facilitating the search for lawyers, and streamlining the process for booking PILs. (35 mins) 2. You are a PM at Hero MotoCorp. Design a new motorcycle for the average Indian, akin to a ‘Splendor’, considering their needs of today. (10 mins) 1.

Following startup, unicorn, tech news on LinkedIn/X and reading on them further Going through a case deck or two every day on LinkedIn/PM School everyday (in peak placement prep season) in case you wish to sit for other product companies as well )","For PM Roles- 1. PM prep, like design, involves building a product sense and it involves a lot of ""unorganised” knowledge acquisition in the form of random internet browsing, reading, looking at real life examples and making inferences. So, follow product managers and unicorn founders on LinkedIn and X, and keep reading on what they have to say; look at upcoming YC companies/Indian unicorns and read on their business models, product design, etc. You get the point! 2. Don’t be afraid to take time to think in an interview. Always think out aloud, draw-and-show, and let the interviewer know your assumptions, raw thoughts, hypotheses etc., however learn to think independently as well, so as to avoid getting biased by thoughts like these. The key is to always maintain a certain logical structure to solving a problem. For placements - 1. I CANNOT emphasize enough the importance of confidence! As my friend (Advait) Vashi said, GIVE your interview with the assumption ki “tera nahi hi hone wala”. No amount of interview rejections define your ability. There is literally nothing to lose, and life has great things for you!"

The initial shortlisting is based on resume (huge emphasis on branch and CPI, cutoff ~9.3 iirc). 2)The shortlisted candidates are directly interviewed on the first day of placements with 2-3 technical rounds, followed by a final behavioral/HR round.","1)Each technical round has a simple question in the beginning, you are expected to explain your approach while also writing code for the same. 2)Each time you solve a question during a round, new constraints/subparts are introduced - progressively increasing the difficulty. 3)Sometimes you might get stuck, your approach might be incorrect, you might not understand the question completely, or something similar - in any of these cases, feel free to discuss the difficulty you are facing with your interviewer, they will help you out as much as they can. Do NOT shy away from taking help, it might otherwise harm your candidacy. 4)The last round is more or less an HR round. Your reasons for joining Glean should be clear; try to phrase them before the interview if you're not confident. There might also be a technical question or two in this round.","1) A very crude example for Glean Start with a BFS-like solution, then Dijkstra, and finally conclude with Bellman-Ford. Ofcourse, the actual solutions you will be expected to implement will not be so standard, but hopefully it gives you an idea of how the question difficulty progresses in a technical round. Each round was ~1 hr. 2) For Da Vinci For the initial shortlisting, there was a subjective exam which included 2-3 coding questions and some other theoretical questions (from CSE topics). The questions were not too difficult to solve in themselves. A lot of emphasis was given on the style of code (code was likely checked manually), and good practices. Post this subjective test, there were group discussions [on zoom], where they asked open-ended questions and anyone willing to answer was given the floor. Candidates were likely judged based on originality as well as relevance to the expected solution. For the software GD, being familiar with good coding practices (in actual industry-level C++ code) is desirable. 3) On the final day, you will likely be asked to implement some functionality that is used daily in the company. It will be reduced to a toy functionality so that you can actually implement it in a single round. You will be given a brief explanation about the functionality and the features expected, feel free to ask for clarifications. There was a single round of ~40 mins on the final day.","1) I had exhausted InterviewBit during the intern season and did not feel the need to do it again. So, I directly moved to giving CF contests and practicing the problemset on CSES. The questions there are relevant and to-the-point, and when you solve a question, there are nice green colours to keep you motivated. 2) For DBMS and Networks, I stuck to the course slides provided at IITK, they are sufficient in my opinion. I did not revise topics like OS, Compilers, Computer Architecture/Organization since I was not aiming for a systems role at an HFT but I strongly advise you to revise them if you are considering systems@HFT, especially OS and Architecture. 3) I did however revise C++ paradigms by reading the articles on learncpp.com, the articles there are nicely organized (both on a micro scale as well as a macro scale), and they also provide MWE's to get the point across. Having a strong hold on C++, both theoretically and practically, is also recommended for systems@HFT.","Do - Start practicing right as your intern ends. In any case, do not be any late than the beginning of the semester. - Upsolve the questions you're not able to solve in a test, they are often repeated. On the same vein, discuss solutions with your peers. - Ask for help from friends with scheduling your interviews/submitting your resumes in December. - Read about the company (their history, their clients, what they do, their product, etc.) you're interviewing for and articulate why you want to join them. A lot of companies gauge how interested a candidate is in them. Do not - Stop practicing when the tests start. Both can be done together, and is recommended. - Be afraid to ""mess"" around the testing environment and find out. More often than not, there are loopholes (within the grounds of morality) that you can use to your advantage. For example, you might be able to print test cases in some environments if you're clever enough. There are better examples that I do not want to include here. - Lose hope ) - There are bound to be some upsetting shortlists, some disappointing environments. Push through it, it will be worth it."

All previous companies would ask some boring questions related to the topic like what this is, what is that without any relevance. However, in this interview, the interviewer, Mr. Sumanyu asked me which project I liked from my resume. And he just started asking questions that led to the very basics which was, tbh, the very correct way to do an interview.","1. What is your fav project in your resume? 2. What would happen if the bot was designed for the Moon rather than on Earth (related to my project)? 3. Explaining the kinematics of the bot I worked on. 4. A little bit into control stuff, but the very basics, nothing advanced.","I wasn’t really expecting any robotics company this placement year. I got lucky that we had an opening on day 6 or 7, I guess. So, I didn’t prepare anything for the robotics profile. In general, have basics covered 1. Kinematics (understanding Degrees of freedom, workspace, joint and task space) 2. Path planning (in robotics) 3. Coding in C++ ( a few robotics companies that interviewed my friends asked questions)","Robotics, unlike coding profiles, has very to the basic placement process. The questions asked don’t require you to be very expert in the field but expect you to know the basics. So, have your basics revised, know how stuffs work and you are good to go."
