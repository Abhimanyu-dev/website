Perikala Sandeep, studying in IIT Kanpur as a B.Tech. student in EE will be joining Intel Technologies Pvt. Ltd. as Hardware Engineer. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Electronics :
1. Google Hardware – Silicon Engineer
2. Intel
3. TI – Digital Engineer
4. TI – Analog Engineer
5. Ceremorphic Technologies – SoC Engineer

Electrical :

1. JLE
7. Ola Mobility
8. AirBus
9. TATA steel

Others:

10. Rakuten
11. Accenture Solutions

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist - It has a CPI criterion of 7(for UG) and open for EE – BT, MT, Dual, Double Major.
2. Test - The test has 2 sections
- Aptitude (15 ques – 20 min)
- Technical (45 ques – 70 min)

The interview process for INTEL is very random compared to the other VLSI companies I have attended. They didn’t frame any continuous questions. They have started the interview by asking about my projects and asked related digital topics which were used in the project. Then, the 2 members of the panel asked questions on different VLSI concepts like Verilog, Digital Design etc.

I have also given interviews for Google Hardware, TI – analog and digital. In Google Hardware, they expect coding skills along with core knowledge. In TI – Digital, I was asked to draw different voltage and current graphs by hand for different circuits. In TI – Analog, They asked me questions from the test paper by changing the circuits like diodes and some RC RL related questions.

Sample Interview Questions:

1. Draw a transistor level Inverter and add a capacitor, What will the voltage and currentwaveforms?
2. Verilog Code of D Flip Flop, Gray Counter etc and explaining each line of the code
3. Some Array based questions in Google Hardware
4. Different VLSI concepts like STA analysis, Digital Design etc

##  Preparation Resources
I have received most of the material from my senior who is placed in VLSI role. He told me the kind of questions that will be asked in test and interviews and shared the NPTEL playlists for Verilog and Digital Design. ESC201, EE210, EE370, EE619 course material. EE619 is very useful for interview process. Apart from these, I used to see blogs and some famous youtube channels like all about electronics, neso academy etc.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
The general advice would be to take the tests seriously, prepare well by going over past years’ repositories, and working on areas where one might me relatively weak. Start preparation early and shape the resume fit for the role. For interviews, try to polish communication skills and temperament. You don’t need to answer every question correctly. Try to do as best as you can.
