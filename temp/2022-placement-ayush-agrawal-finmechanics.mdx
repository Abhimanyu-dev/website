## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist
2. Online Test
3. 2 Rounds of Interview

Interview Process: 

A&M interview had basic HR questions and a case study. I knew I had messed up the case study
and was not selected for Round 2.
JLR asked questions related to Aerospace and Thermodynamics. My interview went well for JLR
but unfortunately, I was not selected for Round 2.
FinMechanics had 2 rounds of interviews. The 1st round had 2 maths questions and some
questions on my resume. The 2nd round had 2 more maths questions and a few HR questions.
The interviews might be stress interviews but you should try to remain calm. I was not able to
completely solve the maths questions in both my rounds of FinMechanics but the interviewers
helped me solve the answers and I got selected in the end. Convey whatever your thought
process is to the interviewer. Only then he can help you reach the final solution.

Sample Interview Questions:

How many solutions exist for x*y = x+y
Prove (p^2)-1 is divisible by 24 if p is a prime number greater than 3.
Resume based questions (What did you do in this project)
HR questions (Why should we hire you; You have a software intern, why the change of field)



##  Preparation Resources
I was studying for CAT and only practised Quant, LRDI and Verbal Ability from the CAT study
material. The placement tests are also comprised of these sections only.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1. Target a specific profile and prepare for it.
2. Try to start preparing at the earliest possible since you will always feel that the time remaining
is very small during the last few weeks.
3. Practice giving mock interviews or at least speaking fluently in English. This will help you
improve your communication skills and perform better during the interviews and you would be
a bit less stressed on your interview day.
4. Don’t get disheartened if you don’t get a job during the initial days or you miss your target
company. Keep giving your best in the next interviews, otherwise, you might lose that
opportunity as well.
