## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do not leave any part during your preparation. Even a small question unanswered in any topiccan make your impressions look bad. For case studies do not give up at any cost. Answer thequestion in the most logical way. If you can study both analog and digital and prepare for bothdomains as they go parallelly. That will increase the insight in both domains. Understandeverything physically as the answer with physical explanations are highly valued in theinterviews.
