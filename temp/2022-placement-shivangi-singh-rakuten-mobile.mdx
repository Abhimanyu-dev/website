Shivangi Singh, studying in IIT Kanpur as a B.Tech. student in EE will be joining Rakuten Mobile as Software Engineer. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
1. Google Software
2. Goldman Sachs Risk
3. Qualcomm Software
4. VMWare MTS
5. Oracle MTS
6. Amazon SDE

## Insights on the Selection Process
Resume shortlisting (based on relevant coursework+projects) and a coding test

Interview for Rakuten was mostly resume based. For me, they checked my knowledge in
communication and networks (since I had the relevant coursework and a UGP).

##  Preparation Resources
GFG,Leetcode, ESO207 and MSO201 course content, Brainstellar

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Start leetcoding at least a month in advance. Even if you know DS-Algo, coding up your
algorithms requires practice. For interviews, practice coding on paper, since the platform used
does not usually have autocorrect. Go throught HR questions and your resume well in
advance. Look at GFG archives for company-specific interview questions. Having a peer
group during placement preparation always helps.
