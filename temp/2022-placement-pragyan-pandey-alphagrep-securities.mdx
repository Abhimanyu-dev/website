## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist based on CPI
2. Online Assessment – 6 Quant question and 5 coding question in 2hrs.
3. Only one interview of 2 hours.

Insights on Interview Process :

Note that Interviews are more of a discussion rather than a question-answering
session. So, try to involve the interviewer while solving a question.
Do not stress on HR prep much if you are focusing on quant or software. I was not asked a
single HR question in any of my interviews.
The interviews will indeed be stressful try to take small breaks if you want and most
interviewers are chill about it.
Prioritize your companies accordingly – Don’t just sort the companies in decreasing order of
the pay. Try to have an idea how difficult these interviews will be and if possible have one or
two backup company interviews in between the dream companies.

Interview Questions :
These are some of the questions that were asked :

Quant 
1. How would you estimate the value of pi using n sided die
2. Use a 1-5 random number generator to create 1-7 random number generator and code it
3. There are 2 random variables in unit of cm let’s say x and y having autocorrelation as some
rho. Now X and Y are the same random variables but in units of m or km what is the new
autocorrelation?

Software 
1. Snake Ladder Question(interviewbit)
2. A simple binary tree question
3. Binary Search in matrix(can’t remember the exact question)

##  Preparation Resources
I prepared mostly for quant and software.

For Quant you can use standard resources that are there - 50 CP, Brainstellar and Xinfeng
zhou. Understand the concept behind each of the problems.

For coding – Leetcode and Interviewbit
Sometimes for quick revision or for learning a new algorithm I often referred to this website -

I’m sharing some of the docs I made of the question that I thought were important

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do’s : 
1. Know each and every word for your resume. Go through the codes of the projects that
you did to have a more clear understanding. Don’t just skip it ki upar upar se dekh lete
hain.
2. Start early – I started around May (Side by side with my research work). Try to do
some coding side by side with your internship work this will help in your ppo interviews
as well.
3. Try before giving up on any skill – I know many people just giving up on coding
because they had a bad esc101 grade. I would suggest try it, give it a month or so and
even then, if it’s not working for you and then you can move onto any other skillset.
4. CPI – try maintain a decent CPI. CPI helps you in getting shortlisted for the companies
a lot more than you think.

Don’ts :
1. Do not stress if you did not get a 3rd year internship. Try to get one from LinkedIn or
else try to self-projects and build your resume.
